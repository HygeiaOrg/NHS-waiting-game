I shouldn't really be working but it's a new , well paid job (started 20th June) but I'm barely functioning. Should I be honest and hang the consequences?

He was shamed and angry and now is barely speaking to me so I fear it may be the final nail in the coffin.  I felt so guilty today about not working but all I could do was hide in my bed and sleep. How do you all cope when the depression is at its worst? I feel the clock ticking on many things, my job, my marriage and my life and I have no energy at all.  What practical things can I attempt to do to help myself?"

Hopefully as the shocks is absorbed he might calm down and see that you were trying to help him. I'm sure it wouldn't be suggested if they didn't think it would help.  I understand that guilty feeling, I really do. To be honest when I am at my worst I don't cope, not at all.  Practical ways? You could do things like taking a walk. It might be for 30 seconds or 5 minutes but getting yourself out. Buying something really nice to soak in a bath with. Doing your hair because personally when I'm bad my hair just doesn't happen.  Little things sometimes, helps me the most.  Take care  xxx"

If there was one thing i could tell you what to do then i and you wouldn't be here but there is always another perspective but then again that's just going back to what i said before. I thought is just a thought right . so what you are thinking is your indicator of how your feeling so, how do you stop that thing you do that makes you feel like you do? even now its not that straight forward . If you can just change your thought to another then another then another then you may of just distracted yourself from the thought that gave you the negative emotion. Look at the things you have in your life already and be general about it ."

Was feeling perfectly happy and fine half an hour ago, now I feel like I want to end my life.  Some background info - diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a month ago (though been having symptoms for a year +), been on citalopram 10mg and a week ago it was raised to 20mg. Haven't felt any obvious effects of the drug yet.  So about half an hour ago I was feeling fine and now I'm in a low, dark mood. Something did happen, only a small disagreement (wouldn't even call it an argument) with an ex-partner who I'm still close to. And now I just feel angry, stressed, depressed, anxious and suicidal all at once. Mainly depressed and suicidal though. They know about my condition and know that small things can trigger my mood swings which makes me more upset, it's as if they don't care how they treat me. I do feel unloved, quite worthless and to be honest a huge waste of space. I'd love to end my life right now but I am 100% sure I will not attempt it, it's just a thought.  I doubt anyone will be awake at this time to offer immediate advice but any advice on how to cope with this in the future would be greatly appreciated. I've got to get up early and this is draining me."

I'd happily live without a romantic attachment ever again. I was so, so scared of giving myself emotionally to him. He promised he wouldn't hurt me. Then he went and hurt me. In a way I'm more upset for myself than the actual situation of being hurt or whatever, because I just don't want to get hurt but it keeps happening, not just in romantic relationships but in life in general. Frustrating....  Yeah I'm going to leave him to think about what he's done and won't talk to him til he talks to me. Not that I want to talk to him at the moment anyway. I hope I sleep.. I'm going to get off the computer now because I need to get up at 9 and never sleep enough as I should these days anyway. Thank you for talking to me, it's weird but good to think that a random person on a computer screen can make me feel better, even if it's just a little bit.

30,Depression Forum,369977,Giving up.,2021-04-12T22:21:46+0100,author,True,98273,London,Tiredandtested,"Hi all,  I’m 42, Covid has taken my once thriving business, along with my goals and dreams ... and pretty much my industry. I’d been in therapy before Covid, my work was the one thing that kept me going, focused and something I was satisfied with, that I hung my self worth to, as everything in my life, my family, friends etc was and still is a mess. I have no support in that area.  So far, I’ve just been able to bury my head, but now I’m slowly coming to terms with the idea, that what I’ve spent so much of my life working towards, well ... it’s just not viable, or can’t exist anymore. I’m not even sure if I could still do it now it’s been so long and my confidence has depleted.  I’ve been able to get some other work, but I just can’t face the thought of the rest of my life being in a dead end job that I know I’ll hate and I have no other qualifications, or anything to offer to any other industry. I’ve looked into doing something at Uni, but honestly I just don’t know if I’ll be able to finance it, or if I even want it! My career has been such a huge part of my identity, I feel so worthless now. Starting again is such a daunting thought at my age, every thought is a desperate scramble to find some kind of answer that I can feel happy about, and I’m coming up short.  I’m a single parent and I’m continuously feeling like my daughter would have a better shot at life if I wasn’t around, I have some savings and assets I could leave for her now, but It’s all slowly being depleted, and the more I think about it, the more I feel my life is coming to a natural end, I’ve lived a for filling life, I’ve enjoyed my career, perhaps selfishly as it’s got me to this point. I’ve always encouraged my daughter to follow her dreams, chase happiness... what sort of shitty mother am I?! What have I got to show for any of this?! She deserves so much better than me.  I’m trying to tell myself ...’just get on with your life’ ‘you’ll find something else you’ll enjoy’ ‘don’t be so selfish’ It’s a massive mountain I have to climb, I’d only just reached the point of being able to consider things like saving to buy a house, having some sense of financial security, and not without so many sacrifices. I had only just afforded to book our very first holiday for last year, of course that was cancelled, I already promised my daughter I’d get her driving lessons when she reached 17 next year.... all of this feels very unachievable now. I just can’t face going backwards, living in fear of not having enough to make rent payments, I thought that period of my life was over, I’m getting frequent panic attacks I Don’t want to do it. Don’t have the motivation or the energy to start again. I don’t want to live like this.  I worked so hard for myself, thinking that no one could ever take this business away from me, I’m in charge and in control of my own destiny.... but then this happens and all I can think is ....seriously, what is the point in doing anything? Now I feel like a complete failure in every sense.  I’m sorry I’ve just ranted on, there’s no real question, and I know no one can help me. I know there’s people who have lost more than I have and that makes me feel guilty and even worse for even being this disgusting, disappointing human being."

That makes you a great mother, and I bet your daughter is proud to have you as her mother. She most definitely wants you to be around for her.  It's good that you're currently working to help pay the bills. It will give you the opportunity to decide what you want to do as your ""second act"" in life. Don't think you have to be stuck in your current job for the rest of your life. Consider it as a bridge from your past profession to your new profession, and you don't have to work your way up the corporate ladder again. Start over fresh.  I think a career counselor may be able to help you. Perhaps you can turn a hobby into a full-time profession. Reading articles or books on second acts may also be beneficial.  I'm pretty much in the same situation as you. I worked in software engineering for thirty years (I'm 61 now), and then I became disabled because of my severe depression. I now get monthly payments from a government program (Social Security), so I'm not wanting for money, but I want to do something else with my life. That's exasperating, trying to find out what I can do. But since I'm getting these monthly payments, I have some breathing room to figure out what my second act will be. You have to do some serious soul-searching for what you want your second act to be. Good luck."

40,Depression Forum,5652,Jumping and stumbling through hoops,2009-07-18T01:52:42+0100,author,True,2138,London. UK,Tortoise,"Hi everyone.  I've been under a lot of stress during the past week because I have to go for a medical assessment in order to justify my claim for incapacity benefit. It's not the first time I've had one of these. The last one was 5 years ago and it was a ludicrously embarrassing procedure.  I've managed to get a letter from my previous Consultant which may persuade the assessors (Medical Services) to conduct the interview at my home, like the previous one. I still have to 'phone the buggers though, to tell them I've sent the letter and explain why I can't keep the appointment.  I made a photocopy of the letter and posted the original yesterday afternoon. Whilst the Consultant's comments have a few inaccuracies (I've had a change of medication since our final appointment for example), I find a lot of it so distressing that I cannot bring myself to read it properly.  All I can think of are the phrases like 'psychotic symptoms' and 'isolated'. I've always envied those service users who seem to get a certain enjoyment or sense of wacky fun out of being regarded as 'mad', whereas I find the whole idea of being perceived as 'insane' or 'psychotic' within my community as a kind of living death-sentence.  Whilst I do agree about the isolation (I have ongoing Agoraphobia and live alone) and know that I need to try and make more social contacts, I have a long-standing fear of other people and what they may do to me if I should be perceived as being a danger to myself or others.  A lot of difficult and unpleasant feelings are arising in connection with a small group of service users who attend a Day Centre I occasionally frequent. I've become extremely angry and resentful towards one or two of them for certain things they have said in the past, and for ways in which they have behaved toward me. When I'm alone in my home these incidents can come up into consciousness and I find myself indulging in angry abusive arguments with these individuals - a kind of acting out which has become almost habitual. It's a bloody nuisance because it can interfere with any concentration I may need to apply to a task I may be doing.  It's reached the point where I want to distance myself from them for the sake of my own emotional balance and to avoid further hurt, but I'm finding it very hard to do so. This would mean totally avoiding the Day Centre which is a part of my support system and trying to find alternatives (not easy to do in my London Borough which is undergoing cutbacks in Mental Health Services).  Does anyone else have a problem with the need to be part of a group with the sense of comfort and belonging this may bring, set against the need to maintain individuality and self-respect within such a social unit?  Thanks for reading this. It's a bit long but I've tried to keep it controlled and coherent. Hope it hasn't caused any distress. Supportive comments would be most welcome.

42,Depression Forum,5652,Jumping and stumbling through hoops,2009-07-19T11:06:11+0100,replier,False,184,Birmingham UK,nickh,"Sorry to hear of your problems Tortoise. The benefit situation is I'm afraid one that many of us are facing at the moment and you will find a great deal more about it elsewhere on the Forum (see Scared of new ESA http://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/showthread.php?t=2822 ).  The socialising is, if possible, an even more difficult problem. I don't know that I can fully respond or empathise as I suspect my own need to be part of a group may be less than yours - having said which I do now spend a lot more time with other people than I used to ; however the outcome of this in the longer or shorter run is nearly always an episode of some kind. Whether this is a price worth paying I don't know. Isolation is certainly easier for me but it is very difficult to maintain self-worth and isolation especially if you have - as I do and I suspect many of us - considerable problems with the former in the first place. The social groups I attend are not Day Centres but MH campaigning ones - so I am with other people with MH issues generally but in a less 'social' setting ; I think I find that easier. Would some such group help you or is it the social side which you want?  I am afraid this is not very helpful - I am just acknowledging some recognition of the problem and throwing out a couple of ideas.  Nick."

Click to expand...  Sorry to hear how painful yesterday was, the fatigue sounds like a real problem. Vitamin D deficiencies can be the culprit especially if you arent exposed to enough sunlight and even more so if you are of a darker skin complexion so you should certainly get your levels checked. Vitamin B deficiency is more associated with chronic fatigue, particuarly B12. Observe your diet, take multivitamins and do get your levels checked. Hope you have better days ahead"

The illness it causes when advanced is pretty awful. I lost 6 teeth in 6 months, couldn't breathe properly, was night blind, started falling over randomly as my legs just wouldn't hold me. Let alone the grinding exhaustion.  its expensive to get tested though....which is why they don't do it as routine  it may be beneficial to skip the testing altogether and just get a bottle and start taking it every day. My levels went from 23 (retirement home territory) to 97 in 6 months and boy, do I feel better.  I actually feel 18 again whereas before I felt 100. Physically at least.  It was a feeling of Something Isnt Right that you cant quite put your finger on, and it affected my entire body pretty much, brain included.  AWFUL. And I'd had it for Years, unknown to myself."

Take the game Farmville for example, to progress you need to add friends, you are then not able to if you don't invite friends, or you watch other people you know doing better because they are more popular.  I also don't really care if my cousin is shagging someone new.  Rant over.  SP"

155,Depression Forum,184956,Ridiculous question - what is normal in a depressed partner?,2018-07-30T11:59:17+0100,author,True,73729,London,Rarebit1234,"Hi,  Apologies if I'm posting in the wrong place. I am totally new to this community.  I don't believe I suffer with depression, though I recognise significant fluctuations in my mental health over the years, but I have been in an on/off relationship with someone suffering from clinical depression.  I'm not asking for anyone to tell me whether I should stay in the relationship, but I am looking to find out whether some of her behaviours are 'normal' for an illness that I recognise as being hugely complex and lacking in norms. Like a lot of people, I've spent more hours than I care to remember scouring the internet for definitive answers, knowing that ithey don't actually exist, so I guess what I'm looking for is some reassurance that somewhere someone else is going through the same with a partner exhibiting the same behaviours.  Please don't think I'm judging. I do my best to choose my language carefully, but as I've never suffered with depression, I know I'm in danger of trying to rationalise and normalise to fit my rather neat view of relationships.  It's worth mentioning that we live in different countries, 600 miles apart, so seeing each other is not difficult but 'just popping over' is not possible.  The first year of the relationship was amazing. Looking back, a few strange things that make more sense now, but pretty much that fantastic honeymoon period where everything is going fantastically well. Then, out of nowhere, she broke it off saying that we couldn't see each other until my divorce was finalised. I was separated but still married at the time. It seemed a very strange line in the sand at the time as we'd been involved for a year by then. She was happy to stay in touch, but it became apparent that communication from her side dwindled to a point where, with the caveat that it takes two to tango, she seemed to pick a huge fight from nowhere and then broke off all communication.  To cut a long story short, we have got back together and broke up three times since then, but each time there is no obvious outward catalyst, and no obvious break up. She becomes more withdrawn and then disappears totally. There isn't necessarily even a falling out. Most recently this year, we were speaking on the phone, she seemed withdrawn and uninterested, the call ended, and I haven't heard a word since. That was months ago. No replies to texts, email, calls, WhatsApp, letters.  There is the odd 'accidental' contact like her FaceTiming a close friend of mine by mistake and hanging up before the call goes through, or 'accidentally' replying without content to an email from me from years ago. I like to think of these as her telling me she's alive and kicking, rather than any sort of pulling my chain.  There is a whole lot more back story to this, including what I've perceived as cries for help that at the time seemed fairly insignficant, but looking back were huge steps for her. I missed them all, because I didn't know what I was looking for. It was only when she left her antidepressants in full view one weekend that I knew for sure she was suffering. That was about two years back, so three years of the on/off relationship were very confusing - she had made some blase comments about depression in the early stages of the relationship, which meant I never included it in my thoughts when trying to explain some slightly strange behaviour when we broke up the first time. Looking back, it was a huge smoke screen, and it worked.  My understanding is that she may have been suffering from depression as long ago as when her child was born 16 years ago, and/or when her marriage broke up 14 years ago, and possibly way back before then. It is apparent that she has been suffering a while and has become adept at hiding it from pretty much everyone. I think that will remain the same until at least the point where her daughter goes off to university.  So, after all that, my question is this - is it common for a severely depressed person to 'disappear' totally for months on end? I don't mean go into hospital, or be unable to get out of bed, as every other aspect of her life seems to go on as usual, at least in terms of work and holidays (I'm too far away to see what is really happening).  I realise this may sound very self-centred, but I'm trying to find out whether shutting out a partner for months is fairly normal, or whether my relationship has veered outside what may be considered reasonable boundaries. I'm not asking anyone to give me their advice as to whether I stay or go. I know she's worth the fight. It's more whether I'm kidding myself that there is something worth hanging in there for.  Any input is welcome. Again, apologies if I'm on the wrong forum."

Many of my plants have got root maggot so I'll probably loose them too at some point and I can't attract any women because I'm just shit and a loser in life. You need to change your mentality, you are not a loser, you have enough power to kill an ant in seconds, and look at how much unity and power ants have. You could tame and teach a dog tricks, you could become a boxing world champion. The power is yours. Just because minor things are going wrong in your life, it is not the end of things for you.

Am I such a freak that other people can't even be open & honest on what they think about me, instead I just get blocked or avoided from people all around me and the worst thing is I don't even know the reasons why. I understand that's its peoples given right not to like somebody I just wish somebody would tell me what was wrong with me. I've been on 5 dates over the years and after the first time off meeting somebody I get blocked when I return home to check my messages all the time it happens. I meet somebody and just when I think things are going well, I return home just to find I've been blocked by them. Today is the last straw in terms of me possibly finding somebody so I'm just going to write that chapter off that part of my life for good now. I know that there is something seriously wrong with me because people are always looking at me, every time I'm out I can just see other peoples eyes looking at me and people in there cars will turn there head to look at me as they drive past. I try my very best to fit in to this world I really do but I'm just clearly not supposed to be here, I'll always be an outsider no matter what. I've been thinking about drinking some alcohol but at the same time that could be enough to push me over the edge and make me feel worse. My pills ain't working either I take one every morning but I don't feel nothing from them and there not going to change the fact that I'm a freak but alcohol can make me feel more human... but anyway I'm just going to stay off alcohol and I'm to go back to being a recluse for the time being.

I've been depressed since I was 13/14 too, never self-harmed myself but I ended up with a lot of issues which I'm still trying to deal with (I'm 22) and also thought about committing suicide (I believe I was close to doing so a couple of times, but I don't think I would ever have the courage to do it).  It's sad to hear that your family doesn't seem to be very supportive, have you ever sat down with them (or at least one of them) and talked about it properly..? Sometimes people really don't know how to handle certain situations, and think that by ignoring it/acting normal the 'problem' will go away. Maybe your mum and sister don't want to understand what is wrong with you because they might think it's their fault (you said your mum never comes up and hugs you - has she always been emotionally detached like this?). Or as Lauli-Ann said - write them a letter. I believe that's the best way to express yourself and as the reader can't really interrupt you it's easier for you to get your point across and for them to take everything in properly. Why don't you try that? Write your mum a letter, leave it in her room somewhere - leave for a couple of hours and see what she says when you come back.  Now - about the girlfriend - I had a gf for 3 and a half years. She was really supportive for most of the time, and even though we had a horrible break up I still thank her (in my mind) for being there for so long. I think that your partner should support you and at least try to understand you - and you've gotta make it clear that by threatening to leave she's not helping the situation but probably making things worse. If she loves you she will understand. If she doesn't...the fear of her breaking up with you will always hover in your mind and it will make you more depressed and anxious. You've gotta know that you have her support.  And yes, maybe, if it's not working with her then you might have to try being alone for a while. And I know it sounds horrible because you think you will be horribly lonely and no one wants to be lonely, but I found that when I sit myself down and have nothing else to do and think about all the things that are good and bad in my life (and trust me there are always more good things in life than bad things) I realize how worthwhile living is.  Have you thought about setting yourself a goal - do you have a hobby? Writing, painting, do you want to lose weight etc.? I was in a really bad place a couple of months back but I've set myself some goals and, even though I haven't achieved them yet, the idea that there is something to go on for really helped me.  Hope this helped a little bit! If you ever need a chat you can pm me too!  x Rere  P.S.: You said you don't want to leave the house. Is that because you don't want to see anyone you know? How about you go for a walk in nature - is there a park, woods etc. near your house. I live very near to a big park and I found that having a walk and just thinking really helped me too. Go there without your phone, or Ipod or anything that could distract you. Think about everything that bothers you and let it all out, cry if you must. How about you try doing that - if you don't want to see anyone then go early in the morning, there are fewer people. But don't sit at home being miserable, it just makes it worse."

I thought I would post on here as a way of sharing how I have been feeling. I am 30 years old and male.  I have had depression for months now, since at least March. In addition to this, I have very bad anxiety (notably over my health and body weight) which has got worse. Symptoms are incredibly low mood, lack of interest in practically anything, low sex drive, under eating and self medicating through alcohol.  I have always gone through bouts of low mood and anxiety, but I think a combination of things has made this persistent and the worst. I had some career-related issues which have basically meant I have been unemployed since June. I have now got a job but do not start until November. The boredom, money issues and lack of things to do have definitely made me feel worse. I feel as though I have no reason to get out of bed in the morning and am just so bored the whole time. I have other things to do (I am writing an academic book) but really struggle to concentrate and my productivity means I can work for hardly more than 2 hours a day. I suppose on a wider level, I feel hopeless and powerless in the world - I have always done well in jobs I have been in and have a good reputation, yet feel a failure that I am 30 and struggled so hard to get a job.  My anxiety is worse particularly after drinking, which I have been doing a lot - and more and more at home alone. Alcohol picks me up and makes me feel less bored, I find my interest in music, the wider world, films improves when I have a drink and it stops me feeling miserable temporarily. It does however give me bad anxiety if i drink too much. I have been on several weekend benders and spent the rest of the week having nightmares, night sweats, terrible worrying. I gave up alcohol for a month when I saw it had become an issue. I had more energy and less anxiety, but I still felt very low. I do not think alcohol is at the root of my problems (I have been a big drinker for years though) but does exacerbate it.  My health anxiety is terrible at the moment. I have convinced myself I have HIV despite being tested negative. I have been convinced I have motor neurones disease and other horrible illnesses based on a few minor symptoms. I have suffered from this for over 10 years now and know it gets worse when I am bored and have nothing to do. My anxiety over my body image has gotten worse as well. I have lost quite a lot of weight since April because I am not eating much and have exercised a lot. I am skinny for my height yet I am obsessed by the thought of being fat.  Some final points:  The ordinary solutions have not worked for me. Exercising doesn't give me lasting happiness. Stopping drinking meant my mood was actually lower. My diet is generally good. I am not lonely and have a wonderful fiancee. I am not sure what I could improve. I am hanging my hopes on immersing myself in my new job, though I know that would just be distraction not actually solving anything.  I have been disappointed at how my friends have reacted to me being this way. I have been visibly different and have told many of them. Yet they seem uncomfortable to talk about it. They are sympathetic (some more so than others) but don't actually ever ask how I am or how I am doing, which I am surprised by because they are enlightened enough to understand depression and mental health. People say it is good to talk and I wouldn't ever discourage anyone from doing that, but for me it has been sad and alienating to see people's reactions.  Thanks for listening to all this. I actually feel a bit better just having written it. Any perspectives from personal experiences would be great."

When you get depressive episodes no one wants to know you, the only people that stuck by me was mom dad and my daughter, friends just droped away so you are not unique in that respect. Having no job is a bitch bordom soon sets in and depression ensues from that, I started working for a charity 2 days a week, that is a break from bordom for at least those 2 days and it enlivens me. I hope your new job brings some releif to you, I think having some thing to do is one of the ways to keep depression at bay. So give up alchol, don't worry about friends they are not the people that stick by you they are just fair weather friends . If you want to talk some more I come on here daily so give me a shout.

My Nan has been diagnosed with cancer, I have been caring for her the last week and she has reached the stage where she cannot eat or drink so unlikely to have long left.  My mother also has severe lung disease and problems with her heart, she has been in and out of hospital but (fingers crossed) not going to go as quickly as my Nan.  I have been having a tough time, I’ve taken off work to care for my Nan and its been very upsetting for me.  I am not usually one to ask my friends for support as generally I am the one who comforts my friends. One friend in particular I have been friends with for over 10 years, and she has suffered with severe depression for the last 3/4 years.  I have been there for her, when we lived in the same home town I had her round my house almost every day, always there for her on the phone etc.  She is depressed because she is in a toxic relationship, she has been going out with a man who has been to prison, slept with some of her very good friends, puts her down, and has resulted in her having a sever eating disorder and alopecia. She knows she should leave him but she does not want to leave him, which has resulted in her being very paranoid, depressed, suicidal, abandonment issues and low self worth.  I have always had extreme empathy for her, and always been there for her though in a way her situation is self inflicted.  I was depressed 5 years ago, and have always suffered with a panic disorder. I know how horrible it feels to be depressed and know it makes you act irrational and self absorbed, and I lost people I cared about during my depression.  I’ve asked her to see me because of my own situation (not something I’ve ever asked of her before) she let me down, I told her I really needed someone because of x y z and said I really wished she had called to let me know because I’m having a hard time. Instead of consoling me, she flipped out saying how she felt suicidal 2 months ago and at the time I wasn’t there for her as much as I should have been, and neither have our other friends have been there either. She recognised it was selfish but it was in her best interest not to see/call me at the time.  I of course was really upset by this and explained that I thought she was out of order for saying that to me when I was looking for some support as I’m solely caring for my Nan with cancer and it’s difficult.  She hasn’t responded to me since, she hasn’t asked whether I’m okay. I have always been there for her, and supported her more than any other person so I feel like it’s a slap in the face for not recognising how much I have done, but also not supporting me under such extreme circumstances.  I do understand that right now, I don’t have depression, but I’m very sad and distressed with grief.  Any suggestions for either terminal illness coping mechanisms/bereavement/or knowing how to approach the situation with my depressed friend would be greatly appreciated."

Last night I heard a Fox crying out and when I looked out me bedroom window the fox was getting beaten to death. How can people do such evil things and get away with it, it makes me so sad and depressed it that was a human they would goto jail its bloody horrible  And please don't anybody say oh its just a fox."

I get the feeling I'm heading for a painful fall and there is nobody who can help me but myself. I have to ask if I really want to get well again and what sacrifices I may have to make.  I just feel so useless. I'm isolating myself in my flat and am having some suicidal thoughts and a great deal of paranoia.  I do go to a Social Services Day Centre, where I am known, but in recent weeks I've begun to find that this place and those who work there and use it, are not providing me with the kind of environment where I can talk about my feelings safely and without fear of unwanted consequences.  I'm reluctant to go out due to ongoing Agoraphobia.This is aggravating my condition, creating critical thoughts and adding to my feelings of being trapped.  Can anyone relate to this? How do you cope when things get this bad?  This is all I can manage right now. I feel exhausted. Thanks for reading if you got this far.  Phil"

I'll try to take your advice about letting time pass. I know that I am making some awful decisions and reacting to events in a destructive and unhelpful way. I only hope I don't do something which cannot be reversed. I think it's called 'cutting off your nose to spite your face' and I'm a past master of it.  As I once read...'No matter how much you blame others for your depression it always brings you back to yourself'.  I just get the feeling that depression is turning me into the kind of person I never wanted to be. A sad and lonely individual who refuses to search for the courage to change and doesn't want to do the hard work that leaving depression behind requires.  Time seems to be running out and I get so worried about the future. I've reached 50 now and over the past few years these recurring depressive episodes have grown worse. I hardly ever seem to learn from my mistakes and end up repeating my habits of thinking and doing.  There seems to be another indignity and tiny act of humiliation heaped upon me everyday. Sometimes these can advance to personal threats when I try to stand up for myself and then the waves of fear that you describe take over and I'm just not thinking rationally anymore.  No wonder I take to my bed and avoid everyone.  Not exactly free am I?  Sorry if anyone is upset or offended by any of this. I tend to ramble a bit and am in a self-pitying frame of mind right now. I would really appreciate any non-judgemental responses and feedback from anyone who may be able to offer any constructive advice.  Thanks for taking the time and trouble to read this.  Phil

It's also very hard not to take things personally when you feel like you're walking round with an open wound.  My consultant has me follow 6 daily rules -  Be safe Take medication Daily meditation Exercise Don't sleep during the day Eat  and he also has me doing something that irritates the life out of me when I'm depressed but I do it to shut him up. I have to make a list of my ""blessings"" and I'm not allowed to include money or possessions. Some days it's hard to find more than four and I only get that many if I mention each cat by name.

We have known each other for almost a year now and I really enjoy her company, we have conversations about our training and what we get up to in the week. I have been holding back since discovering that she has a boyfriend, however ever since we first met, she has always stared at me, even when I look back walking away from reception to leave, she is still looking. She also likes most if not all of my Instagram stories, so to be honest I’m just keeping things platonic for the time being. This relationship has slowly turned into envy and jealousy when I started to look further into her past achievements. She was an A star student in school and went on to do a bachelors degree followed by a masters degree which she attained last year. On top of this she has competed in kickboxing since the age of 10 and has competed in multiple sports. This has made me reflect on my own life decisions; when I left school I didn’t want to focus on going to university as I wanted to study mechanics. Over time I started to gain interest in sport and exercise and completely ditched the idea of mechanics. I studied a BTEC Level 3 in Sport and Exercise and achieved a D*D*D* (A*A*A*)  Even though I have achieved top marks and was top of the class at college, a part of me wants to go back in time and study A levels instead of mechanics because deep down I can't replace or redo the one thing I have lost, which is time and youth. Things seemed effortless for her because she knew what she wanted, and she got it and I had to take the long way round because I couldn't make up my stupid teenage mind. I'm 23 and I am going to do my first year of my bachelors, she would have been 18... I know I sound like a simp but I wish I was like her. This has been going around in my head over and over again for days and I can't forgive myself for my decisions in my past. I have been crying a lot and contemplating suicide recently, what sucks even more is that she lost a friend to suicide not so long ago; I wouldn't want to put anyone through that again. I understand social media can be deceptive, but she has had a far superior life to mine, friends and career wise and it has completely knocked my confidence in myself. I'm not sure whether to carry on or how I can amend for this, maybe I'll do better in my next life."

There are nearly 8 billion people in the world. Trust me, for the rest of your life, if you want to find someone with a “far superior life” it will always be deceptively possible.  Your issue is one of mindset. Stop treating life as a game of comparison. Shift out of that perspective. It is not at all productive. In fact, a piece of advice is to delete your Instagram account and get off social media all together. It‘s a big waste of time. And there are studies that connect using social media with mental health issues, eg depression.  If you want to learn about social media and the impact on mental health go to Google Scholar and search “social media and depression“ or “social media and mental health“.  Another thing to consider is that it does not take that long to conquer the world. A person can start with basically nothing, everything wiped out, and within a few years have a thriving business. Read some success stories that came out of disaster or failure. Expand how you think to include more than just stories of a kid that is now great at chess because they started playing at the age of three."

For you, I try to figure out what cognitive distortion this is--mainly to help myself in catching myself from having these negative thoughts.  Here's the link I use: Cognitive Distortions  This might be the cognitive distortion of Polarized Thinking (or “Black and White” Thinking):  In polarized thinking, things are either “black-or-white” — all or nothing. We have to be perfect or we’re a complete and abject failure — there is no middle ground. A person with polarized thinking places people or situations in “either/or” categories, with no shades of gray or allowing for the complexity of most people and most situations. A person with black-and-white thinking sees things only in extremes."

Been working well overall for my mood, but has never helped much for my insomnia even though I find it very sedating.  As of late, I'm exhausted all the time. I can't concentrate in uni and I find everything piling on top of me. I just wanna stay in bed all the time. Apathetic.  I assume this is something to do with my medication stopping working, or something to do with the winter. I dunno - either way I need some sort of help. I saw the doc the other day about my sleep, and I have some zopiclone to take (I know it's addictive and I plan on taking it no more than 2x in a week, so this pack should last me about two months which is great). I THINK the main reason I find sleeping trouble is due to having really restless legs - I've mentioned it to my doctor but they never really listen when I talk about it. Anyway, that's not what this is about  I dunno what to do? I've tried Fluoxetine and Sertraline in the past, and although they gave me a good buzz of energy, they eventually made my mood spiral downward. I don't wanna come off Mirtazapine so soon, but I feel these signs of depression slowly creeping in.  I also got a referral for some CBT (mainly for my sleep). I've had CBT before, found it a little helpful and I'm not sure what further CBT will do, but I'm willing to give it another go.  Any advice? I have a GP appointment booked on the 4th, and I want to ask for some sort of medication for my restless legs in order to help me sleep, but I don't know what other options there are for my depression.

I'm surprised you are having those issues with the 45 when it's usually from what I read/hear the lower doses that have the more sedative effect.  Have you tried going to a lower dose.

You should follow your doctor's advice on medication. I take medication for depression and have since I was first diagnosed with clinical depression 25 years ago. The medication today is much better than what they used to use for depression, it doesn't have all the side effects or make you feel 'drugged'. It's really effective at taking the 'edge' off, but I would still follow up with therapy. It sounds like it would do you a lot of good.  SSRI medication treats some kinds of depression, but it's not effective on others. Still, your doctor can steer you in the right direction on that. You sound as if you're at your wits end, with that in mind I wouldn't hesitate on medication if your doctor thinks it would help. Baby steps."

Try to accept these feelings and don't fight them, honour them. Move slower through your day, be gentle with yourself, like how you take care of your children when they are sick. You show compassion and support. Whatever gives you even a bit of relief, a sedative, music, exercise, alone time, etc. do it.....no it might not make you feel any better but the distraction can help ease the intensity of the feelings. Try to notice if you have moments where you feel better during the day, I know for me, it comes in waves, so if you can hang on until you get that moment it will come. This is temporary and you should get an award for getting this far, its the hardest struggle ever!"

Often , counselling and medication go hand in hand. Antidepressants lift the mood so that you can get more benefit from the counselling. It’s entirely your choice though. I admire that you want to solve things yourself and you have taken the first step by arranging counselling.  Things must have been difficult because your 7yr old will not have been in school and you also have a tiny baby.  I hope you will let us know how you go on -if you want to that is."

If you cannot provide the money to fix it's leg up, they will probably euthanize it. [i would expect them to do this, i hope to god i am wrong though]  i cared for a blk bird recently whose leg was damaged at the hip, 2 reasons i didn't take it to the vets, [well 3 as i was hoping it would get better by itself]  one i thought the vets might 'take authority' of it as it was a wild animal & it didn't belong to me two, i did not have the money to pay them to 'fix' the bird.

This seems to have triggered my depression off - as I no longer have my coping mechanism in place. It's got worse recently and my meds have been upped from 20mg, then to 40mg about 3 months ago, and now 60mg yesterday!

Their own Owner could not call them and have them come - they were famous for Breakouts and running wildly down the middle of the street into traffic  All I needed to do was silently open my car door and stand there - they would immediately do a 180 and come flying back home to get in the car.

I would see your doctor again, one med doesnt work for everyone the only med I found that worked for me was zispin but it crippled my joints literally so weighing up physical or mental health I chose my physical as I had a 6 month old baby at the time and needed my limbs to open bottles and change nappies ect. and my gp basically gave up then and said we I cant think of anything else that will work ( but luckily I have changed gp and have been referred to a psychiatrist and feel I am on the right road (although my psychiatrist is a waste of space) at least I feel on the system.

I’ve always been able to see the progression of my depression quite easily, as when everything is going downhill, the progression of everything going from bad to very bad has the same pattern each time.  I’ve been ‘stable’ so to speak for probably around 3 years. But over the last 4 months, I’ve seen all of the warning signs and just watched everything unfold.  I know that things are at their worst for me when I have a feeling of such intense boredom that it makes me feel as if I’m watching a movie in front of me and I’m no longer connected with people or my surroundings. Everything feels incredibly mundane and pointless. Big things bore me. I work with people who have severe seizures. And yesterday whilst somebody was having a seizure, my main thought wasn’t panic or concern for the person, just ‘oh dear god, this is so incredibly boring.’  In the past when life doesn’t hold any interest for me, I sleep. But this time, I can’t sleep at all. I’m awake for days on end to the point where I feel frantic because there’s nothing I can do to make myself feel better. And I feel unbearably miserable. I can’t even cry about it anymore though, because despite feeling miserable, I feel numb in a kind of trapped way?  It’s nice weather at the moment, really sunny out. But everything feels dark. Like literally, dark. Nothing looks or appears vibrant, everything has been ‘dulled’?  And time is going so slowly, that I’m clock watching (that’s another one of my ‘warning signs’) and in the past, sleep would always be my fall back because it meant I was able to bypass time going slowly, because I’d just be asleep. But now I feel stuck in this horrible state and I feel like I have no way out.  I don’t tend to talk to people about this kind of stuff, so I guess I just wanted to write it all out in the hopes that somebody else has experienced these feelings, because I really don’t know what to do."

I get like that too, especially when I am feeling fragile.  I say hello, ask a question, make a post... I can see how is online and see people ""liking"" and responding to other posts. And no matter what I seem to tell myself, it still gets me down when what I've put on Facebook goes unacknowledged.  Maybe one way to think of it is, how do you use Facebook?  I tend to browse through the wall... I don't post much on other people's statuses because I am not sure what to say or I am not sure how what I want to write will be interpreted. I look at people's pictures but I only ""like"" the one's that really really stand out. I look at the bar on the right for the latest activity.  But I don't scroll down too far on my news feed or the live feed on the right. I don't go to other people's walls very often to see if I've missed anything. Often I don't notice a post until someone else has commented on it and brought it to the top of my news feed.   People use Facebook differently.  Some people only have time to quickly check their news feed and think ""oh I got a private message, I should check that later"". (If they are like me, they will forget or they may not be in a good 'space' to reply)  Others spend hours on it.  It is challenging.  I don't think people not responding to your status updates means they are ignoring you, they will have seen it on their news feed, they might just not know how to respond.  If a message or a question goes unanswered, maybe ask it again...  Something like ""I sent you a message saying hello before, I was wondering if you received it? Just wanted to catch up..."" etc... Or ""Hey, so I was still wondering if anyone knew the answer to this question....""  ""Bump"" the question so to speak.  Anyway, sorry for rambling on! Hope some of this helps! Hope even more that it makes some sense!"

I've been on facebook for a good few years, and have a grand total of 76 friends. And pretty much all of them are people i would go for a drink with, or meet up with in real life.  If i post a status update and people don't reply, i don't really care. I don't post that often, and i hardly ever comment on other people's stuff, so why should i expect them to do the same. I guess i view fb as a way of kinda keeping in touch with people without having to remember to email them (which i wouldn't always have time to do) or phone them (which i wouldn't like doing). But i'm not particularly active on the site really. Guess it depends on how much fb is part of your social life. It's not really a big part of mine - i mean i don't use it TO socialise - so i'm not that bothered if i'm ignored.

May I suggest, posting thoughts, ideas, and feelings? Now, I tend to post things that are in no way directly asking a question or expecting a response. For example, If I had a good day I'd probably post something around the lines of ""Had an amazing day "". If someone replies to it or likes it then good, If not, it doesn't impact me in any negative way because that's something most people tend to skip over anyways, no matter who you are. Ask yourself, when you see an update from someone saying they had a good or bad day, would you feel inclined to reply to it? My answer would be no, seeing as to how its irrelavent to me.

I recently got separated from my wife, and left and right, people would post things related to love and relationship statuses (but seems that's ALL they do). That wasn't helping me get over my wife whatsoever so I just stopped going on Facebook altogether. Now, I log on once in a blue moon, and when I do, I still notice people post about the same thing (love and whatnot).  It's interesting too; how it shows a sociological pattern. It seems most people write about the most wanted and needed human emotion because they yearn for it. It's interesting to see that no matter who your are or where you are or what you do; love benefits us all, and everyone has a desire to love and be loved."

I think razza has the right idea, ie being careful about how and when you post. I think that the most important thing is not to come across as a 'show off', and yet I see lots of my 'so called' friends seem to be doing just that. Also, it's worth trying to think about what the 'other side' are going to think of my post. Will they see it (whether it is or not) as a chat up line, might it offend them, etc. Also it's worth bearing in mind that if they have say 1000 friends, then my comment might be difficult to answer. Even so, I was a bit upset yesterday because I think I misjudged an answer to a comment I made on Saturday evening, actually it made me a bit angry, but I've had to simply walk away from it, rather than tell him what I think.

519,Depression Forum,197296,For the first time I was sent home from work,2019-03-18T15:29:51+0000,author,True,79482,London,JBubbles,"I am 25 years old and have worked since I was 15/16.  Last Friday I was sent home from work for the very first time. They think I'm depressed and urged me to reach out...so here I am.  I don't really know how to go about this...so I'll just start from the beginning.  I've always thought there was something wrong with me, since being young I was different from my friends and would always isolate myself. I have a history of self-harm which I am only disclosing here as no one knows who I am. I don't self harm any more as my partner is watching me. Me and my dad used to have physical fights as I did not like the way he treated my mum. Finally, at 16 they kicked me out and I went to live with my partner.  I've recently moved in to my own flat with my partner, and everything is coming on top of me. I'm in nearly 10K worth of debt just trying to live independently and it looks like we're going to have to move back in with my family soon.  In the past 5 years I was dealing with my partner's nan's dementia, been sexually assaulted by a friend, my close cousin committed suicide, my grandfather passed away and we've just discovered some sexual abuse in the family.  All that aside, I always get waves of feeling so low and crap and I can't go on as it is pointless. I feel like we're all gonna die in the end so why try, why go to work and why bother? It comes in waves, I can be fine for a year then BAM it will just hit me, and below is the most recent way it has happened.  Last Saturday I was at a family party when things were brought up. I took a weeks worth of holiday and spent it in bed or on the sofa. Couldn't wash or clean or anything. I couldn't go outside either. I realized I was listening at the door to see if my partner was coming. Weird.  When on one day I couldn't take another holiday, I got my partner to drop me to work. I looked so trampy but I didn't care.  At work everyone was asking if I was okay, which killed me. My friend came and gave me a postcard after she went away and I just broke down. My team leader took me outside and I just started crying...I was looking all around and people were watching me. She told me I may have depression as she had it once. She sent me home and said it's important that I go to the doctors, get a sick note and focus on getting better.  I don't know how to do this. I still haven't been back. I'm trying to get an emergency Drs appointment right now but I keep hanging up. How is me feeling down an emergency? Do I just ask for a drs note? How the hell do I do this? Is my doctor going to look at me as if I'm a lazy person who just doesn't want to work? I'm so scared.  I feel so alone, please help me."

Keep trying and know that there are professionals that are trained to diagnose and help you find the tools you need to feel better. I get feeling like the depression and bad feelings are yours to deal with. That, however, is self-limiting and an underestimation of the capacity of others. I only say this because it is what I tell myself when I feel that way. You can always come here and vent or ask questions or just read through the trevails of another. It can be comforting knowing that a lot of what we feel is very similar to others. Anyway, it's nice to meet you and welcome to the forum."

It targets the sodium dependent serotonin transporter to inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin by neurons. According to the unofficial equation:  dopamine + cellular energy = pleasure + serotonin  It essentially makes you feel like you just had a lot of fun. It makes you feel ok.

Your meds may make you sleepy for the first few days but that will wear off as your body becomes used to it. I was on sertraline many years ago and managed to work whilst on them , so I don’t see a problem with you getting back to work. Your GP will probabably gradually increase your dose till your on an amount that works for you. A lot of people on the forum take sertraline so I’m sure someone will be along that can give you more advice.  Take care Daf"

I know myself, and I don't have depression, that if I haven't worked in my type of field, oh not for many years. I do voluntary work, and at least that way, any mental health issues making me unwell, Iknow i can then phone and say sorry, I can't attend the voluntary work on that day.   I am a litte concerned, that nothing was prescribed for depression apart from the counselling. On that basis, I would make a return back, remind that you are so depressed, couldn't you have some and I do understand, that medicine is frightening to take, medication for your depression, or make a referral to the community mental health team, and t hen, let them the pshychartry team, reassess you and take things from there. Mental health team, for your borough this is.   Oh and by the way, I am very sorry to read and hear about your case history.   I'mm glad though that you have been prescribed, med for your anxiety, might take time for the medicine to actually kick in to work in your system. Only for 1 or 2 weeks, maybe this will be.   More importantly when you are able to, do keep posting and let us know, in due course, how you are getting on with your med, for anxiety, and more importantly for depression.   You've made the first step communication about mental health by reaching out, and I am sure that MHF and myself included, are very proud, of you for you to have done so."

My sister left home, went to USA and start her new life and of course our parents were so proud of her (me too do't get me wrong) but it was like they just forgot I am there... I was only 14, moving to new school, just lost the only friends I had...Starting to use drugs, ran away from home, stop attending school, from straight A student I was below average.. had my first boyfriend, who was drug addict, stealing my money using me for sex.. I started stealing from my parents because of him... started to ham myself...gained weight... With the time i got better overcame the loss, decided to make a change and i did it.. I got one really close friend at school, but she started taking drugs find new friends and literary told me that I am too boring for her.. after 2 years there for her she left me behind... I stopped going out.. Isolated myself completely.. I remember I spent the whole summer in my room reading books.. self help philosophy...I made drastic changes.. I lost 25 kg, I was looking better and feeling better.. I found ,my passion everything I wanted to do... I went back to straight A student.. Got accepted in University in New York with a scholarship..as well as in London... I was ready to go I knew I will smash it... even though my parents couldn't afford to send me money I knew I will get a job I had the confidence I will, I was on the top of my life there was nothing impossible in front of me I was the happiest person my education, my work, my social life, my relationships even in my family... After 2 more years of mastering foreign language and studying, here I am living my dream in London... yeah but not really.. I m here for year and a half.. Don't put much effort in my studies, miraculously my marks are really good but not me... I could find a job for more than 8 months.. I gained all the weight back.. I don't have social life I cant afford to... I dont have friend in uni... My parents took a loan to help me while i get a job but even then all my money were going for a rent and travel often didn't had enough for food... i find my first job cleaner- couldn't keep it for more than 2 months.. housekeepers who didnt even speak english were telling me that thats the wrong job for me I am not good enough I can even clean the toilet... I left.. then I moved to another agency started in a hotel where the job is even more demanding... it was the same .. everyday I used to finish work crying going home alone in my small room...meanwhile I was still having sex and taking drugs with whoever I find.. I got sacked from the hotel after 4 weeks.. then facing unemployment again I honestly started to think about prostitution.. I was sleeping with whoever I found even people I met on the internet... I was so lonely... My friends just forgot about me when i left my county.. my family was just criticizing me that I don't do enough... The light of hope came when I met a girl who was leaving her job and recommended me...the job was illegal but still the payment was ok and it was a cashier job... everything was fine until the manager started making comments how sexy I am how he was dreaming about me and ""wants to kiss my pussy"" ... the guy that was also working there were obsessed with me and because I accepted him as a friend on facebook he thought I am in love in him... when i told him to leave me he would not talk to me, humiliating me in front of customers shouting at me.. even grabed me in the stockroom. my manager knew but didn't do anything about it...My manager left me alone once I told him that I am not that type of girl and he is married.. but not the Indian guy.. Aside from the problems at work financially I was stable at school things were getting better, I started chatting with a guy from my country who I knew from before... I decided to go back for a holiday and see him.. I thought I am inlove he was saying he is inlove... before I go back I was kicked out from my place and found another i had to move in when i got back... I went to my country he fucked me and told me he has no feeling about me, I understood that one of my friend was diagnosed with MS and developed epilepsy and lost her seeing, my aunt was getting worse had a stroke and was diagnosed with clinical depression, my father alcoholic getting worse as well.. my other aunt had cancer...After two week there I got psychologically smashed.. started smoking week again and getting drunk every other night... When I got back to London I moved to the new place.. my housemates were cool.. get close to two of them really quick... on of the guys is now my present boyfriend... they were drinking and taking drugs almost every night.. I couldnt wait to get out of work and have some fun with them.. with my boyfriend everything was going just fine even getting better especially after i thought i wont trust a man again.. the landlord kick as all from the house, so we decided to live together.. Found amazing place cheaper.. we were happy for few months at work things were getting better... until a month ago.. I was sacked without notice for happy year.. after working on christmas eve and christmas overtime for free... My savings are almost gone.. with him we are arguing most of the time... soon I wont be able to pay my part of the rent or my bills... he cannot afford to do it.. I cant get any financial help from uni, my parants cant help me... whenever I apply for a job I got rejected.. cant even make it to a interview and its pretty much for simple jobs like cashier barista cleaner fish and chips... It seems I cannot keep a job for more than few months.. I am not good enough to do anything... if i get a job I am most often sexually harressed by the manager or some of the workers.. I only hear how i am not good enough for this or that.. I have no confidence at all that i will get a job.. I couldnt even get one in McDonalds...My boyfriend criticizes me about everything that i am doing nothing when literally I cant do anything but crying all day.. everyone who I tried to approach to get some help seems to turn their back on me... I will be soon unemployed, homeless 20 year old student... I can't go back to my country since pretty much I will be 20 years old unemployed, homeless girl with unfinished education...my parents don't want me hope.. honestly with my fathers alcoholism I don't want either... I cant get and keep even a job that i would hate like a cleaner for example...its like i am not good enough even for that.. pretty much I am ugly fat incapable of anything girl... if i cant keep even a cashier job o a cleaner job.. how I am going to help people one day when i cant help myself.. how will I peruse the clinician career that I always wanted... I am 20 financially broken, inexperienced, without family friend or someone to rely one.. and even though I know my life is in front of me and it can change for good... i am sooo tired of waiting the good that I dont even want to wake up anymore.... I don't see meaning in my life I dont even think that there is someone who will notice I am missing... I just want my life back.. I want to succeed in anything as before...not to be miserable all the time"

It seems unfair that one person should have to go through all of this without that foundation of support from your family. You really seem to be on your own, and you seem to not make very good choices in boyfriends either so that is probably best until you can sort yourself out. It seems getting a job is the number one priority, so i hope that you can regain some of your strength which you obviously have after getting through all that, and regain some confidence, and get yourself some work. I think that you have just been very unlucky and come across some unkind people. Listen only to those who have tried to support you, and ignore those that have put you down. Good luck and i hope you find something soon so you can continue your degree as that seems important to you.

Sorry if that dosent make sense, i was homeless for a while, they basically said i wouldnt be given somwhere to live untill id been sleeping rough so long that i was about dead, real helpfull"

Getting harder to get a job and keep it...And once I starting feeling down it's like all the failures from before all bad experiences and unhappy memories are coming back... Once I get a job and start to enjoy it at lest a little bit .. feel financially stable I am the happiest person in the world who can achieve everything and then going down again... As a psychology student reading my post analyzing my mood and reading the summary of my life that I posted here over and over again... makes me think I am bipolar... or that I have cyclothymia... or maybe I am just paranoid and look for an excuse for my moods and behaviour...but either way that's another thing that stops me to visit a GP... If I get diagnosed with something.. it will close a lot of doors for the future.. I can't risk it...

I'm training to be a teaching assistant and people at my placement have been noticing that something's wrong, and I couldn't make myself go to college yesterday. Everything at there has changed as I've had to move year groups twice and feel a bit out of my depth, and the college work is making it even harder. But I think I want to get qualified though, but I'm really not sure at the moment. The past week I've just been hating everything about me and I can't get myself out of it, no sure I even want to. I had a slightly better day at home yesterday and I said to my aunt in the evening that I was really sorry I'd been so crap this week and she said it was ok but that it made her tired and I need to learn to manage things a bit better by myself. So this morning I haven't gone to her at all and told her I was fine but I'm not and I don't know how to deal with it on my own, I just want the world to swallow me up. I can't really talk to anyone else about how I'm feeling cos I don't really understand myself, and I really want to cry but for some reason I can't. I've been thinking more about suicide this week, I don't think I'd do anything cos I'm scared and I promised my aunt I wouldn't, but sometimes I feel like it's the only way out. Then other times I feel like I'm dead already anyway so it wouldn't make any difference. I don't want to go back to CMHT because they couldn't really help before and it was just stressing me out so they said to leave it til I felt ready for therapy but I know I still can't talk. The only person I could trust is my aunt but now I'm scared I'm wrecking her life so it's like I'm completely on my own now and I can't handle it Sorry for rant, always feel like I've no right to post anything here but not sure what else to do"

You're obviously in a bit of a rut at the moment, and it's at times like these when it's difficult to see a way out. When you feel like this, then all your college work will seem more of a burden. I can sympathise with this as I have a OU exam on Monday. If the work is getting too much for you atm, then is it worth talking to your tutors to see if you can defer some of the work?  You talk about not wanting to get in touch with CMHT, but you didn't mention what meds you are on. What's the situation with them? Have they been adjusted lately? If you're not ready to talk to a therapist face-to-face, well you're always welcome to have a rant on here.  Realising that what you're going through is a temporary feeling will give it some perspective. Hang in there and keep posting."

I think it's a pretty common response to abuse, especially emotional abuse because that's part of an abuser's game - make you believe that you can't be good enough because they know that people who have self-belief won't tolerate their abusive behaviour.  Think it through rationally. Your boyfriend is not going to put you as second best to his parents. They won't replace you. It's comparing apples to oranges, relationship love and parental love are worlds apart. Apart from that, people don't think in terms of best and second best. You don't order your friends and family from top to bottom - no one does.  Going numb is also a response to abuse. It's like your brain's automatic defense mechanism, at the time of the abuse the emotions are too powerful to cope with, so you switch them off to protect yourself. It's been three years since my abuse stopped and I still react to stress by going numb. I still haven't found a way to stop it happening yet."

When you're depressed, does it help to know someone is there for you, even if they're not present?  I feel like I'm treading a fine line between letting my depressed girlfriend know I care, and becoming a nuisance and therefore pushing her away or making her feel worse.

On my bad days, like lay-on-the-bathroom-floor bad, I know that I'm the only one who can help myself get better, but feeling alone is the worst thing in the world and often contributes to the depression more. It has a way of making you feel like no one cares about you and the world would be better off without you. So I think reaching out does help.  There have been times when my husband has found me lying despondently somewhere and his reaction is either to leave me alone to myself, or to say, ""Come on, let's get you up."" Neither of those solutions are particularly helpful. Sometimes all I really want is someone to hold me and say ""I know you're hurting, but I'm here.""  I commend you for reaching out for help. Don't forget to take care of yourself too, though. Best of luck to you and your gf."

I am definitely prepared to do whatever it takes.  The problem I find is that there is so much conflicting information and there is nuance in every approach to helping. I can't tell whether I'm helping by saying anything about her illness, or whether drawing attention to something she's spent years keeping hidden is making things worse. I've never tried to force any conversation.  My ex-wife suffered from depression and all she asked was that I held her and told her I was there for her. We went through some bad times together, but pretty much always together.  The problem I have with my girlfriend is that she shuts me out completely for months on end. Total silence. I'm struggling to find any evidence that is typical depressed behaviour. Unfortunately most articles about any kind of 'silent treatment' are from the point of view of narcissism or mental torture.

I've been advised that this shouldn't be a behaviour associated with depression if properly diagnosed and medicated, but could point to undiagnosed bipolar or other personality disorder.Even then, six months is unusual if not unheard of.  Yep. Well I am diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and Recurrent depression, although I think I actually have Bipolar type 2 (they're working on it ). Certainly my patterns of mood and behaviour show this more than the former, but I was diagnosed with that when I was on antidepressants and everything sped up, hence why that diagnosis was given. Borderline is a much faster change of mood than Bipolar; hours or a few days at most; Bipolar type 2 is mostly littered with depression, with a few shorter lived high periods. It's gets complicated when you consider things like rapid cycling etc. Going quiet for months on end would not point towards Borderline for me, although I see how that must sound given that that is my actual diagnosis at present! The only thing that really pulls me towards that possibility is that the quiet spells for her could be something called 'devaluation' which occurs in Borderline. Idealization and devaluation is basically when someone thinks someone is great, something happens and then they think they're not so great at all. So, strong interest, to no interest. It could potentially be that but I can't know for sure and I'm sure even you wouldn't given that it's a long-distance relationship with minimal contact.  I'm quite medication resistent, they don't tend to do much for me, at least not antidepressants anyway and in hindsight I'd say they make things worse for me - which would be another argument in favour of Bipolar rather than Borderline. How does she respond to medication, if at all?"

It's a fine line between trying to stick it out and knowing when to call it quits. I think if you approach her and say that you need to talk about things and that you need to know some things from her side then you should know what to do. If she goes along with it and does do that then obviously the relationship may have some life left in it, but if she continues to ignore you or just isn't willing to talk then the time may well be up for that particular relationship.

What does that do to help someone with a mental illness who doesn't work?  I do agree in some ways. Most people I have met are only concerned about themselves.

They are very cheap to make, built with recycled items, but are some of the nicest homed in the world! When you move into these communities the people who have already built their homes help you build yours because they know how! Then you help the next newbie.

I'm just as guilty as anyone (saints excluded) in putting my own interests first. Even though it's respect for family that drives me, not the naked pursuit of material wealth, I cowardly surrender to the whole 'doing the normal thing' mentality and struggle to find anything that really satisfies me. The tattered remains of my Christian faith leads me to love people regardless (""loving the sinner, not the sin"" and all that) but I've 'given up the ghost' about getting into heaven. I'll stay here and rot, albeit thankful that I've found something to love. When the Revolution comes I'll be timidly cheering from the sidelines but it won't change anything. For what it's worth I think a mixture of fearlessness (the opposite of godfearing at any rate) and a 'survive at any cost' way of thinking will drive what remains of this godless society to its inevitable extinction but by then it will surely be revealed for the inhuman beast that it has surely become. The battered survivors can pick up the pieces then...as always."

It sounds like you are a disbeliever which is fine, I've nothing against that, but to say why doesn't God make people better is a bit like saying why do we have to have night time and day time, why not just daytime?

Last year I finally got some help, am in therapy and have also stopped drinking. Last summer I was put on sertraline/zoloft for 2 months (1 month on a low dosage then 1 month on a higher) and it made no difference, other than bad side effects (nauseau and fatigue).  3 months ago I was put on a new anti-depressant (Citalopram). The nausea side-effects are still quite bad. I am not currently sure if it is working, some days I feel okay but then a lot of the time I don't think I feel any different.  I'm just confused and not sure what other options there are. I get that everyone is different, but I have read a LOT of testimonies of people on my medications (those who it has helped and those who it has not) and there is some themes/patterns amongst those who it has worked for, namely that they feel significantly different/better on it and I am not at that stage.  The only other meds I've read about are things like lithium, but they seem only for people with bipolar.  Any help would be great"

Don't expect much within that time frame, there is no ""light switch"" med that I know of. You somehow have to find the strength to carry on and battle though until something works.  For Citalopram (my bolding):  It usually takes 4 to 6 weeks for citalopram to work., although you should start to feel better after 1 to 2 weeks. Side effects such as tiredness, feeling nervous, dry mouth and sweating are common. They're usually mild and go away after a couple of weeks. If you and your doctor decide to stop taking citalopram, your doctor may recommend reducing your dose gradually to help prevent withdrawal symptoms. You can drink alcohol while taking citalopram, but it may make you feel sleepy. Do not take the herbal supplement St John's wort while you're taking citalopram. It will increase your risk of side effects. Meds saved my life, but they're not a cure for the underlying issues, for that you must go deeper."

Also it's easier when the therapist is there, but not when you try and put these ideas into practice on your own. I didn't realise how hard the sessions would be and like you i tended to need a drink after a session and it took me a few days to come down again.

Was on a real downer to start with when I went in - not helped by the fact I had done my homework wrong (typical of me I had already gone one step ahead).  Anyway, she said we were going to discuss work next and I was fearing the worst. I started to explain an episode that happened 10 days ago and the impact it had on me for the next couple of days and she was totally taken aback.  She basically said that just the smallest idea of something to do with work had resulted in me having what she described as a mini breakdown. I continued through my diary and the same thing kept happening.  She asked if I wanted to return there to which I replied no. She then said that she believes it is the spectre of returning there that is making me ill. Not a great surprise but the next part was.  Her suggestion was as we have so much evidence that it is the way I was treated there that had made me ill, I should waste no time in consulting a lawyer and go about seeing what sort of payment I can get out of them.  I was totally stunned, particularly as all the psychiatrist kept saying to me was that it was important that I returned to work as soon as possible. I know which one I am listening to!  Feel better than I have felt for ages now. Here's hoping it continues."

If you have someone in your life that you trust and who loves or cares about you. Someone who understands how your illness has effected your life - then it might pay to consider bringing them with you.  I know this won't suit everyone but it is an insurance policy to ensure you get the best possible treatment and to remove some of the arbitrary practices that go on out there.

NOTHING gets rid of it, nothing fills the emptiness. No matter how much I keep myself busy, work, binge drink, binge eat, have sex, sleep, etc, the feeling just doesn't go. I feel nothing... But on the other hand sometimes I feel everything. 'Emptiness' doesn't even describe it properly - because it is something - it's like a dragging down that I'm constantly trying to get rid of. Ugh I sound stupid and it doesn't even sound logical but it's the best way I can put it.  I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and have been on 45mg Mirtazapine for about half a year now - the doc plans on keeping me on it until next spring. I have to say that my moods are so much better being on this, and I have stopped self harming, and I no longer suffer from panic attacks, so that's all great. But it still hasn't really got rid of this empty feeling, other than helping me avoid self harming during times when it's bad.  What is it? Is this a normal symptom of depression? My friend with BPD is the ONLY person I know who gets this too and understands what I'm talking about, but I'd like to hear other people's experiences on this, and whatever your diagnosis is too.  When I've mentioned it in the past my doctor hasn't really focused on this, probably thinking it was a part of the depression. But my depression seems pretty stable since being on this dose and I still get this so I feel like it's something else that's going on.  Any advice?"

664,Depression Forum,240403,Talking About: Caring About Ourself,2019-11-15T17:29:15+0000,author,True,84402,London,LouS,"We’re all here for the same reason- we suffer with depression. Some of us may have been hospitalised with this, others of us may not be able to get out of bed in a morning and some of us may be functioning on a day to day level with a black cloud hanging over us. For me, it’s a dark thunder cloud, constantly in the background. I hold down a full time job and do the day to day stuff- feeling like hell most of the time. Some of us are lucky and have close family to support and help us out, others of us don’t. I live alone, my family live a long distance away and although they are aware that I take anti depressants they do not have a proper understanding of mental health and do not talk about feelings. Saying that, I am aware at the end of the day that nobody else can get me or anyone else suffering with depression out of this dark hole and that it is up to us as individuals to try to move forward and make the best of our circumstances. Depression is disabling, for some more than others and to try to move forward we need to take baby steps. One of the ways we can do this is about caring for ourselves even if we feel nobody else does. Just small things that we do can make us feel a little better, even if things are really bad. This may feel like a mammoth effort but when these things are done we can feel a sense of a achievement and that we can do something positive to help ourself. Examples may be getting out of bed and taking a shower when we’re really struggling, tidying and cleaning our surroundings, reading a book or cooking a healthy meal from scratch. These are all small milestones which nourish us physically or mentally and if we can do our best to keep these things up they will hopefully have a lasting impact on our mental well being. To move forward, we need to be kind and not neglect or criticise ourselves."

And I have been caught out crying in front of people which has been highly embarrassing, like at a wedding reception when someone asked me a question! and at work a few times too.

Maybe the unusual thing is you notice however as clouds said if the thoughts make you unhappy then consider what action to take. A friend with OCD once described what it was like to me. For him it started with thinking he’d done small things that caused harm to others. That grew into worrying about big things like causing a car accident.

693,Depression Forum,373444,I feel completely lost and panicking!,2021-04-26T11:51:58+0100,author,True,101502,"London, UK",likesforzoe,"Right now having a bout of panic in the midst of an important project that I am working on and I don't know how to keep myself calm and sane. I feel like I am going to go mad if I continue trying to do these worthless stuff. This has been going for a while now, and lockdown made it worse.  I am well aware that I need to do something to “fix” myself, but I don’t have any motivation for it. And since I am not doing anything, I constantly blame myself and feel guilty about my “self-imposed” predicament. As a result, I feel completely lost – typical, but I am struggling to find any meaning in anything I do. But to take a step back, let me tell my story a bit first, and apologies this will be a bit of an unattractive self-pity story to get things off my chest.  I have always been this stereotypical relatively high-achiever (not the super high-achiever or a crazy clever type though), people-pleaser. Life brought me to the UK as an immigrant and now I am only hanging in here to get a second citizenship and not become forced to go back to my home country that hosts my loved ones. However, I am not sure I want to continue living in the UK either. I haven’t been able to find myself in my home country and I hoped moving here would help. Alas, it didn't happen. Life has thrown some small curve balls, to which I failed to react in a way other than, as my therapist puts it, ""jailing"" myself ""in a high tower without any windows or reasonably sized doors for people to enter"". So, the UK didn’t work out as well. My sole focus over the past years was to keep myself stable, pass through the immigration hurdles, work my ass off, and that’s it. I have been enjoying my job to a certain extent as I learnt new things – but no more. Meanwhile, I felt this void in me all my life, being in the UK also didn’t help filling it. I haven't managed to establish new friendships, have meaningful connections. I am blessed with a few good friends here from my past life – but no one new.  Anyways, about two or three years ago, I have developed a massive crush, an infatuation, to a person I should not have. I am not going to get into details of the ""I should not have"" part, and instead seek your trust in me. Usually, I am (or I thought I was) good at managing my feelings towards others, and a crush at this age feels a bit embarrassing. But this one proved unexpectedly challenging. This infatuation made my life truly miserable. Moments filled with extreme intensity routinely ended up with strong desires to run away, pull my hair out, or do something. I was literally unable to eat and sleep for a while, lost around 10 kg in a month, came to the brink of getting fired, but this unwavering crush also made my life equally “worthy” for a while. I felt “Wow - there is something (or someone) I want in this life. I can feel something again. I desire.” I felt she completed some missing piece in me, something I was yearning for, something that fills the void I have always feeling. I saw something me in her.  As I worked on internalising that I have no chance with this person, our differences, her current relationship and partner, how we lived in different circles throughout our lives, how I am not in the same league with her, how I don't know much about her, relationships, or myself, or how I am not seen in the same light that I am looking, I got motivated to become a better person and heavily invest in myself. I said, “obviously this person was out of the realms of possibility for me, but if I invest and become a better myself, maybe, I thought, I can have a chance with someone that is at least similar to her. Even I can’t find anyone, I would become a better person.” Of course - she was on my mind. Saying otherwise would be a lie. It's impossible to kill down completely that little piece of self that constantly says ""nothing is impossible"" and childishly denies the realities. But anyways, with this motivation, I started reading, attending courses to improve my soft skills or increase my self-confidence, going to events, meeting new people even if it’s just for an evening of chat, oh hell, I even considered speed dating and online dating (both of them are extremely out of my comfort zone). I said ""let me start again with a therapist, leave this emotional baggage at the door, I can do this, let me fix this life, make it more liveable, and it’s not too late"". She started as a seemingly innocent crush, but I managed to turn this crush into something productive for myself. She became literally my inspiration, my rock, my motivation, and a newfound reason to live for a long time. While doing all this, I really tried to see herself as she is, as much as I can of course. I tried to not put her on a pedestal, not idolise, see her flaws like I see mine, and basically see her in her true colours. I wanted to have something real, something with its good and bad, not a blinding infatuation. I don't want a saint. I am not a saint. I just wanted whatever that might be.  The magical thing about her was how she effortlessly made me feel that I am welcomed. That I didn’t have to hide a piece of me, she cared about me, she was interested in me and who am I as a person. She made me feel safe, comfortable, and supported. This was something new for me. She made feel that there are people out there that I can connect with, people that truly matter. I let my words flow freely with her, my insecurities, my fears, things I was too embarrassed to say to my family or people I call best friends for years, all flowed naturally to my absolute true shock. I didn’t understand how I managed to utter those words to another soul without feeling mad. This didn’t feel like the me I know, but I liked it in a weird way. It showed me that I can really connect despite my lack of feelings for anyone else, I can establish connections that feels like there is a meaning to it.  As we talked more and more as friends, she taught me or made me realise a lot, about life, about myself, about who I could have been, about who I should be, and about the missed opportunities in my unlived youth. All she has done was to tell me her stories, her description of herself, her past, her insecurities, her lived youth, insightful comments, how she sees life, and how she sees me. I was in this weird limbo – where I was scared shitless to get closer to her as it started to hurt like hell, made me live and breathe my insecurities in every single cell of my body. It was increasingly becoming challenging to hide my feelings, and the reality that I won’t be able to get her wasn’t something easy to deal with. But, I was also unable to get enough of her. I wanted to see her again and again, be uncomfortable but close to her. I wanted to know everything about her, good or bad, regardless of the bad thoughts, feelings or memories they would trigger in me. I wanted to enjoy being in the same room even just for sitting and doing completely irrelevant things, her laughs, how she plays with her hair, how she gets excited when talking about what she wants to do in future, how her eyes twinkle when she looks into my eyes as she talks, and how she shares the very same lack of motivation or cynicism with me that creeps up at times. I wanted to be able to share more with her. Be with her. I wanted to see her again and again and again, even though my insecurities were shouting full force at me that I would bore her to death every. single. time. I wanted to talk to her without feeling self-conscious and lose myself in that conversation. I wanted to keep myself wide open for her. I wanted to get hurt again if it was for her. I wanted to touch her, caress her hand, her cheek, or give a hug in which I lose myself. I just wanted her – whatever that may mean.  I also knew that I would mess up massively if there was something between me and her anything more intimate than my current friendship. I know I am not ready for it, though I am in my early 30s, and I know how late I am or too old to start as a new person in the relationships. I know how she was a rare specimen for me that I felt in the same frequency with someone even though we are products of two different worlds. But, still, I know we are not that compatible. She would get bored to death with me with my inexperience, ignorance, and childishness. So, I wanted her to be a good friend, a sincere, true, long-lasting, good friend. For years, maybe even for life. I wanted her to be part of my life. Without me calling for it, she used to say she felt lucky to know me, have me in her life, call me as her friend, how she felt safe with me, how she felt very close to me. She used to respond whenever I say that I care deeply about her and that she is my rock, how she shares my feeling of closeness, and how our feelings were mutual. To be open and fair, she didn’t lead me on, she was very clear on her commitments and how she cares about her partner, her history with him, and I have always been sure that she didn’t see me that way. To the extent I can be - of course. In the midst of all this intense emotional turmoil, I always felt bad that I feel this intensely about her and if she knew, she would have thought I was bat shit crazy.  So, I felt, I should work for becoming good friends with her for life. I said to myself: ""Let’s hang out, let me become part of her family, her loved ones become my loved ones by default, even her partner"". He seemed a nice guy that I can be friends with. So, let’s just become the one friend who always makes you feel safe and supported for each other. The one friend you can always rely on. The one friend that fuels you to become a better version of yourself.  Years passed like this, and after all this, she is still special for me, I am still in touch with her, we have our every couple of weeks coffee get-togethers, and quick video chats while in lockdown. But recently I noticed that even her presence in my life does not give me a meaning or drive anymore. I am confused. I don't know what to expect from her anymore, or where to put her in my life. I know I still want to be part of her life and her to be part of mine. I know I relied on her (or my feelings towards her to be more precise) far too much and far too long as a source of a will to live, but everybody needs something, right? She was filling a emptiness in me, though not satisfying the “need” completely, I get that. I still sometimes feel overjoyed with love as I think about her even though this was not possible, sometimes I flatly feel confused and depressed when I think about her. I would still do anything for her – but I am unable to convert this to a productive energy anymore, which makes me feel lost like I lost one thing I managed to find over years that kept me going. And with that, I started feel I don't have a ground that I can stand on. I always knew inside that this is an unhealthy thing that I am doing, focusing on one person – even if I used it to better myself. But when you manage find something that gives a semblance of value in a person, a glimpse of love, you grasp onto it. Especially if this is an extremely rare occurrence.  Now I try again and again to motivate myself, to put my head up like a little prairie dog to look for things, I do start questioning everything again, what do I want from this life, what do I live for, struggle for, what do I want from my entourage, what do I want from her to be exact, why do I live and breathe, why should I read, why should I work, why should I try to be a better person, why am I still not burning all of the bridges and trying to get another passport – what is the point? I feel panicky when I think I need to continue living like this. I want to pull my hair off.  I get these rare waves of motivation to do something, read a book, watch something, initiate a change in myself, change my job that gives me existential dread every day, find a way to feel content for a second or two; but all of these waves are very short-lived. I end up feel alone, like everyone. I feel that I won’t be able to break my barriers, walls, or get past the emotional baggage I carry around. I feel like I am wasting years, a life, and a career that I worked very hard for. I still feel that big void in me. Nothing fills it. I don't know how to fill it. I feel that I am unloveable though I yearn to be loved. I sometimes find myself in these rosy dreams in a parallel universe where I became a father to a lovely daughter who I can shower with love. Then I feel lost again. Hopeless. Powerless. Disconnected. Alone.  I don’t know what to do other than to live through this meaningless existence for my parents, who would be devastated with an early departure. That's it. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to continue.  Wow – if you have read all this, a big kudos. You should be a gem of person and your loved ones are lucky to have you. You are important, and I would have loved to do something for you, order you a pint, give you a small token of my appreciation, or give you a big hug. Thank you for being out there and existing."

Worse comes to worse ALL of my friends are married most with kids or already coupled up and I feel very inconvenient when I'm meeting them having to discuss how happy and in love are with each other where I'm not even able to date anyone... I really come to the conclusion I'm either ugly or there is something wrong with me... I want to fall in love, hug and kiss someone! I want to do things with my other half but this doesn't seem to happen any time soon. I'm really fed up....  I'm using gay apps, chatting to people, organise to meet them and they just disappear with no excuse! I feel I have really tried everything in the past i.e. meetups, live flirting, gay apps but nothing really helps. I do consider myself as a handsome guy, well-educated and successful professional but in my personal life I'm a real failure (this is the way I feel). I'm fed up doing things on my own and keep trying to date/ meet people. Today I met a big group of friends and most of them were couples so I felt really bad because I was on my own.

Feeling very overwhelmed.",2020-10-01T16:27:28+0100,author,True,94625,London,JTodd,"So, I've had to reach out to this group before, but things are getting worse.  My mother (61) is a life-long alcoholic.  I'm currently in America, she lives in London. My wife and stepson are American; for the best part of a year we've been splitting our time between the UK and the US.  We've been in the US for around a month this time. About two weeks ago, my mother went on a big binge drunk (which she usually does when we're away). Nobody is watching her, she goes off the rails. But this was the worst one ever.  She's a manic depressive bipolar individual on numerous medications.  Basically I had a week of trying to talk her down from a massive bender and a manic episode, brought on by being drunk for a week and going off her meds. There were at least 16 calls a day, mostly babbling drunk or sobbing crying. I managed to talk her down, eventually, she got back on her meds, calmed down the drinking. She was very sad and apologetic (she usually is). I can't really describe to you how bad this was, it doesn't come across in this paragraph but it was bad. Almost constant calls and sobbing and slurring for days on end. Calls starting at 7am. Went on all day. This is while I'm trying to home-school our son, staying at my mother-in-law's house. Our boy needs a lot of attention; he's extremely high energy. Anyway, this was the worst bender ever and she's been going on benders (drinking every day even if not on a bender). I can't describe the stress and worry of it. Also, my wife and son are currently applying for UK residence permits and my mother going to pieces could jeopardize that.  For the first time in her life she acknowledged she has a drinking problem. Said she needs help. Says she can't stop but she wants to. That's never happened before. I don't think it's a magic switch, and there is no cure for the illness she has, but it felt like something. Maybe a first step.  I got her a doctor's appointment to discuss it with them, she's waiting to hear back about meetings and assistance and medication to help her to stop drinking (she ""self-medicates"" due to anxiety).  Anyway, sounds like a happy ending; I managed to talk her down, get her a doctor's appointment, order her medication for her. Got her through it.  A few days later (yesterday) it was her birthday. On the same day, she got paid (disability benefits) She was ok-ish in the morning. Could tell she'd had a drink, but I had expected that because anything - celebration, tragedy, anything - is an excuse for her to drink.  Based on recent events and conversation I hoped it would be minimal or short-term (it's often the case, any time I'm away this happens - she drinks like crazy, goes quiet for a few days (sometimes total silence), comes out the other side of it. I've learned to wait it out. This episode was different though. As the day went on I heard from her less, she stopped calling, got the occasional whatsapp message. I could tell something was up. Pretty late I got a message saying goodnight and could tell that she was probably pretty hammered. I hoped it was a one day indulgence and she would pull it back together.  Well, today, she called me at 2pm her time, and she's very VERY drunk. Extremely slurry, couldn't tell what time it was, thought it was the evening and she was going to make dinner. Just wasted.  I can't believe there's such a quick turn-around on this. I can't describe the stress of thinking we're back to where we were only a few days ago; I didn't get a week of (not even sobriety), just not a catastrophic bender.  So now she's not answering her phone or reading messages.  I'm desperately hoping this isn't going to be a repeat of the last massive bender where she goes off her medication because she's too drunk to take it and slips back into a terrible manic episode.  I'm just exhausted. This has been a very very stressful year for me already (as it has for everybody to some degree - thanks pandemic) and I'm not getting on very well with my wife either. So it's just feeling really overwhelming. I seem to spend my life in service of others and I'm not getting anything out of it. I spend all my time trying to take care of my mother or doing things for my wife and son, and getting nothing out of it. Just a further kick in the teeth and more problems and stress and worry.  I'm feeling totally hopeless right now, like nothing is going to ever really be okay again. I'll just go from problem to problem; my mum's drinking, my relationship with my wife, everything is so hard and just not working. It's one thing after another.  I'm losing all hope over here."

Anytime we aren't actually talking while she's sober, I just assume she is drinking.  You can't control an alcoholic's drinking, not from across the Atlantic.  Work on what is right there with you, your son and wife. And do what you can to care for yourself, you are carrying a heavy load, you need self care.  It's hard to hear, but your mom has to handle her own issue. I understand your worry, but you need to stop taking all of her drunken calls. It just enables her, and upsets you.  So sorry you are dealing with this - it's hard enough watching a close friend drink herself to death, much less a parent."

I don’t ever think anything is as bad as it probably is, so I would never speak to someone properly about this, I guess i’m in denial. Everyone seems to have their own group chats, have their own sly digs at everyone else, and I seem to be left I’m the dust. Maybe its because I went to uni and everyone else stayed and saw each other, but even still, I’ve known these people for a long time, so I shouldn’t feel like this. I wouldn’t even be able to pinpoint the beginning of these shitty emotions, just one day recently, all this shit just entered my head. I wouldn’t even say it was at the beginning of lockdown, because I was still with M, probably the closest I’d been with Konnor in a while, my family weren’t at home so I wasn’t being constantly annoyed by them, I had left my god awful job. It’s probably more recently, when, as I already said, people seem to be doing more without me and having private FaceTimes and shit. I really hate to admit it, because its such a petty and childish emotion, but I am jealous. I guess another word for it is FOMO, just hate ‘being the outcast’. Its in quotation marks because I know its only me that sees it that way. Whenever everyone else does stuff, laughs about something I don’t get, they aren’t thinking about how I feel. Its selfish, yeah it is. However, I feel like my whole life, with some exceptions, I try to be as selfless as I can. Going out my way to try and keep everyone happy, checking up on people who don’t do the same thing for me. 2nd year Sixth Form was the most damaging for me, losing so many close friends, feeling like I’m constantly in ‘beef’ and yet I still tried to keep everyone happy. R, V, M, J, D, K, Y - all people I considered my closest ‘boy-mates’ at some stage in these recent years. How many am I properly friends with now? 2/3 of them max. They each had their beefs with each other, and at times, I felt like I was in the shittest situation being mates with them all. For example, if one day I went out with J by myself, I knew the others would get salty, I would feel the same. But it was so unfair that they had a go at me for it. As much as I probably didn’t show it, that really affected me. I always tried to put my friends first, but sometimes it bit me in the arse. This is why I feel I deserve to be a little bit selfish, just to fuck everyone off for a while and sort myself out. The reason I wanted to go to uni was so I could have a fresh start, leave everything from my city behind. All of the people I have annoyed, lost, forgotten about, just leave that shit behind and start over. I think meeting all those new people, who know nothing about me, who’re going through the same ‘new beginning’ shit as me, really benefitted my mental health. It was a breath of fresh air. Having to come home killed me. I obviously missed family and friends from here, but returning meant coming back to all of the old, shitty memories, beef, pettiness etc. I know the same can be said about me, 100%, but it seems nobody has grown up. The same shit seems to be happening, day in day out. I seem to be in a constant cycle of distracting myself by getting football booted at me, to then going home and being deeply upset again. Trying to get back into cycling again, helped momentarily with staying distracted, but the emotions soon catch back up to me. Of a night time, I regularly stare at the ceiling, listening to the same songs on repeat, thinking why/how things have gone so wrong in these last few years. Again, it seems like peoples’ lives are just progressing and getting better - getting into relationships, getting promotions - and it seems mine is still just stood still. I do find going out for drives by myself, listening to my favourite music, exercise and weirdly, hitting things, helps with my mental state. I have so much more going on inside my head, which I’m trying to figure out and fight back against, this is just a start. I hope writing things down will help not just me, but others see that this shit happens, all the time. I think I need help, but I don’t know how to go about it right now."

When you take care of everyone else no one knows what to do when you are down. You are their leader. How do you give support to the leader? Leaders don't like to ask for help even when things are really bad. Even now you are feeling guilty about not thinking of other people. Sometimes you can't and need to take care of yourself first.  You do sound very depressed. Seeing other people as fake is dissociation. Butterflies in the stomach and head ache could be anxiety. When I was in therapy my psychologist told me I was just seeing things negatively. That annoyed me because it sounded like he was saying I was a negative person. Which I knew I'm not. But he was right at the time. I wasn't seeing any positives. I couldn't because things were going so shit.  This covid doesn't help at all. Many people are struggling with it.  Take care of yourself. Make sure you are getting proper vitamins, fresh air, sun, and exercise. Therapy may help work through some of those issues. Talking about it on the forum can release some pent up emotions. Meditation helps a lot too. Pills can offer temporary relief but in the long run they can do more damage than good. Same with any substance. Hope things start to look up for you."

I knew since I was a little kid that I had schizophrenia. What I didn't know was that I was also bipolar. My ex wife was bipolar as well and we either got along great or wanted to kill each other. I had anger management therapy which I think made me mask my bipolar from my ex girlfriend. I would just not talk to her when angry so I wouldn't blow up at her which was a big part of our breakup. Coincidentally I also am an alcoholic. I realize now after typing all this that I haven't really answered your question but maybe you can find something you can use. Long story short there are many of us who have come to realize that we wont recover. I know I will get progressively worse and I accept that. You may be just the opposite but that's something only you will know. (And I wish you the best of luck) Take care of yourself.

I've been like it all my life - only that it gets worse as I get older. Can't sit still. Pacing. Moving my legs. Above all else, it is more of a mental itch that I need to do SOMETHING. ANYTHING. Something reckless preferably - only that it helps temporarily.  But then I feel too depressed to stay out of bed long enough to do anything productive with this 'energy' I have inside me. I go from having psychomotor agitation for weeks, then psychomotor retardation for weeks, sometimes switching in the same day. It's so confusing as I never know what 'state' I will be in (I only know these terms as I study psychology at university - can be helpful for us who suffer from mental disorders!)  I don't even know what this feeling is? I have a diagnosis of depression, but bipolar disorder runs in my family and I often wonder if this is more of a symptom of that. I'm currently tapering myself off Sertraline and starting Mirtazapine, which has made me feel ultra sleepy. I haven't had any success with SSRI's in the past, often times they make me worse and feel more hyper/restless, so I'm PRAYING that I have better luck with Mirtazapine.  I was just wondering if anyone experiences similar? What is your diagnosis? What has your doctor said about this symptom? Any medication available?"

I have no experience with SSRI's but i have a ADHD and PTSD diagnosis these two dont mix well, i get ADHD energy and PTSD stress followed by being too hyper and not being able to direct my energy somewhere constructive, thats when i have to train or be on here to release some mental energy and physical energy in other ways, i also move my legs and cant sit still i dont know what it's from exactly i had it all my life i only truely relax after workouts and in bed, after sex too.  Some things that have worked for me is of course exercise, meditation, and not much more, and abilify doesnt really help it at all, (im on abilify) it makes things worse it seems, i get this unatural energy from the medicine on top of what i already have, this can be frustrating and just like you i never know when it will hit.  However if i focus this energy i can do alot with it, so it's a nuisance and a gift at the same time id say, im currently not medicated for ADHD, i hope this helped a little bit as you are not completely alone, as for agitation i dont get that i believe its due to medication aswell, abilify that is."

Your mum has a cpn i hope, your dad has a nurse and doctor of his own, you don't need to worry too much about them, just call their nurse when they need help perhaps.  Just be, is what i would do. Find something that reminds you who you are and what you enjoy. It is hard with covid but soon there will be more to do again, the weather will be warmer and that helps us all to feel a bit better.

I've had depression on and off for years, was on sertraline for about 6 then doctor weaned me off a few weeks ago. Since then I've been feeling increasingly irritable, low and tearful, and my most recent relationship experience has really pushed me into a dark place.  Some history - I spent 6 years with a very abusive partner who nearly destroyed my life. Very long story and this probably isn't the place, but it was bad, and what caused me to go on anti depressants in the first place. I left that relationship a few years ago and have been wary of relationships since, not least because I wanted to focus on my daughter who is now 18. A few weeks ago a friend encouraged me to try a dating app (bad idea!) and I met someone who seemed really genuine. On the first date he told me he has bipolar, that wasn't a problem. We got on great, he was really keen, calling me every night and treating me well. if anything he was a bit full on and I was cautious, but he was still respectful and nothing physical happened between us (mainly because of lockdown and lack of opportunities!) We went for dinner a couple of weeks ago and he referred to himself as my boyfriend, sent me a text when he got home, all seemed good. Then the next day I suggested we should be in each other's support bubbles so we could go to each other's houses, and that seemed to be the moment that changed everything. Seemed ok at first but that night was the first night he didn't call. Then the next day he said he was ""having a wobble"" and would be in touch when he felt better.  I spent a week worrying about him, thinking he was in a depressive state with his bipolar. I tried to give him space but just sent a couple of ""checking in"" messages, which he again responded to saying I was ""a really special person"" and he'd be in touch. Another week passed and total radio silence. I tried to research as much as I could about bipolar so I knew how to support him, being mindful of space, but the longer it went the more paranoid I became. Last night I suddenly had a gut feeling to check the dating site we'd met on, to find he'd been active within the past 24 hours and uploaded loads of new photos, including some he'd sent to me over the past couple of weeks. By this point I was a combination of upset, confused and angry, and sent him a message asking to know what was going on - which he of course ignored. This then sent my mind in a spiral of basically madness, and I sent about 20 other messages, all read and all ignored. Because my abusive ex would ignore me for weeks on end as part of his tactics, this has triggered me beyond belief. I know feel all those feelings I had before, all about not being good enough, and I don't know what to do to dig myself out of this.  I don't really know what advice I'm looking for, but it would be great if someone could remind me this will get better"

I would have been fine with being dumped as it was so early into the relationship, it's the complete lack of explanation/closure that hurts so much.

Hey,  It is not unnormal, over thinking things will not help. (I do this, It really doesn't do a lot of good) Best advice I've ever been given which works while I'm in a good state of mind (read through a few of my posts, I have issues which have set me back), however you aren't in this place so it's good to start as soon as you can. You are 19, you have goals, this is great! But leave them in the future. One step at a time, think of what you need to do now to start the process, once youve started that and coming to the end of completing it, think about the next step. Don't set your goals too steaply and you'll be able to cope a lot easier. unfortunately with depression, it comes in waves, the easiest thing to do is just try and take baby steps as much as you can, don't expect too much of yourslef and take things slowly. You've always got this place as a rant/crutch to get you through. Hope this helps a little x"

I can't keep the thoughts at bay and I really truely feel like I am loosing the plot.   Forget that, you are ill NOW. When you are sick throwing up everywhere, you wouldn't make an agreement to say you will go on sick leave in 2 weeks time, would you?  Does your employer actually know how you are feeling at the moment? I ask because I don't believe any self respecting person would ask you to work in your condition.  You feel like you are going to pass out and you have lost your concentration. Therefore you are a potential safety hazzard to yourself and your co-workers. You are also a financial risk to your employer, if you can't concentrate on your job then undoubtedly you will get things wrong more often.  I would speak to your boss, perhaps phone up tomorrow morning? Just say you are feeling worse and you are sorry but you just can't stick to your agreement, you feel continuing to work at this moment will make you even worse. Don't let them try to haggle you into doing 1 week etc. However, perhaps if you feel up to it make an offer of say doing 2 days per week for the following 2 weeks.  ONLY agree to what you believe you can do, you have no obligations to agree anything. Remember that you are sick and your employer forcing you to work anyway is a discrimination towards you."

I haven't been sleeping properly for months however the last 3 weeks have been particularly bad and I've only been managing 2 or 3 hours even with tablets. It's left me feeling incrediably lathergic.  I haven't yet seen the pdoc. However I spoke to a cpn on Tuesday and the app should be in the next couple of weeks. I really hope they can balance my meds a little as I am finding this all incrediably draining.  In terms of work I am still there but hope to be gone by wed or Thursday at the latest. I amnot finding it easy at the moment and struggling to cope is taking it's toll on me.  Gosh I am sorry I have ranted on. I guess it's only 4 more days. I just hope that I can started to get my life back on track sooner rather than later. It just seems all too much to bare at times.  Thank you so much for your support.  X X

The problem is that doctors have disagreed with eachother and swapped between depression and bi-polar disorder.  I have been on 3 or 4 different tablets and none of them seemed to make any difference to my mental state, although some of the induced vomiting and other unwanted side-effects.  I will post a few of my symptoms and see if anyone can offer some advice.  Constant fatigue Terrible sleeping patterns - I was recently going to bed as my partner left for work ay 8am Feelings of worthlessness and apathy Occasional suicdal thoughts - but not too often Severe lack of motivation Irritability  These are the problems that I notice.  My girlfriend on the other hand suggests these problems in conunction with  Emotional detachment and coldness I hate everything, apparently Anger problems, I have smashed up things in our flat before Self-medicating with alcohol Mood-swings.

I was pushed and shoved between the options of depression and bipolar for a while too. It ended up I asked to be seen by a new psych and he diagnosed me with bipolar and tried me on the medication Seroquel. When I first started Seroquel I got worse, had bad symptoms, but this psych assured me to keep on taking them. I thought he was pretty insane at the time and didn't know what he was talking about, surely these tablets were making me worse? But I kept taking them as instructed and gradually I noticed they were making me feel better. My friends and boyfriend noticed my mood swings were not as frequent and not as bad, they noticed I wasn't as anxious and I was generally a happier person. I was also able to sleep at nights as they helped me to sleep  So basically, the end of the rant is, you could try a new psych to diagnose you, and if the tablets you have been given do give you bad symptoms, try them out for a while. Some tablets give bad symptoms whilst your body is adjusting to them..  Emily.x"

All I can say is that is that the symptoms you describe are far from uncommon if you read many people's accounts here. I am not sure it is wise to get too concerned with exactly what the diagnosis is as long as you are getting the right treatment - which it would seem you are not. If often takes a long time to find the right medication for any individual and a good percentage of people are resistant to all pharmaceutical treatment. Have you had any talking therapies?  Nick.

I have thus far been resistant tablets, but haven't been on any for 2 years or so and find that it is getting bad again.  I tried a talking therapy twice and I disliked the two people and was unable to come out of my shell and talk. One was a proper psychiatrist and had a very medical and cold way of talking, he also patronised me often telling me not to ""be silly"" etc and the other person was a social worker who didn't seem to have any real medical knowledge and he didn't bother with any probing questions.  Basically what Id like is some medication in conjunction with some useful therapy.

I know that it can often be a long struggle to get access to a suitable therapist, given the lack of resources in this area, and the fact that everyone's needs are different - it took me years to find the right person. But it is worth it in the end.  To some extent it is necessary to accept - if you are that sort of person as I am - that opening up is always going to be difficult.

I know that it can often be a long struggle to get access to a suitable therapist, given the lack of resources in this area, and the fact that everyone's needs are different - it took me years to find the right person. But it is worth it in the end.  To some extent it is necessary to accept - if you are that sort of person as I am - that opening up is always going to be difficult.

Why is it the curse of human beings that we can see things from several different points of view?  No offense intended, but aren't we just ordinary people under all this Mental Health Mumbo Jumbo? Someone on here implied that 'normal' people can't have fun. Now what is that supposed to mean? Are we all some kind of elite clique on here then?  Don't get me wrong. I can recognise the value of sites like these and welcome the opportunity to use this facility. I attend a Social Services Day Centre from time to time, but I feel little affinity with most of the other service user's who go there. Perhaps I'm not as 'ill' as some of the others or maybe I'm not playing the game properly and they are all secret wizard's whilst I'm a naive sincere fool!  My CMHT has a thick red file with my Mental Health history in it. Every scribbled note that a Psychiatrist has made about me goes in there. Naturally, I'm curious. But I'm also ashamed, frightened and angry with it. I'd like to rip it up or burn it and leave all this confusing business behind in some alternate existence. Then again, I can cling to it and say, ""Look...here's the evidence. I'm a depressed man who warrants enough interest for a thick file... or do I have schizophrenia like one of my brother's may have had? But if this means it's genetic how come my other brother doesn't have it? How did he manage to escape whilst I'm locked in with all the keys?  The advantage of that file's existence and being on their list does have some advantages of course. Every time the Benefits Agency start poking around for evidence of my incapacity or pick my medicated brains for a loophole I can't justify, I can wave my status with the CMHT in front of them like a shield and say...''Look. Go to my alibi. Still sick. Can't work. Resent being pushed into a situation I can't handle"".  I'm doing the best I can but the meds aren't really working. Therapy? What Therapy? I only seem to read about techniques like CBT or Mindfulness in books. They don't translate into the real world.  Maybe I'm in the wrong cachement area but it seems like chaos wherever I am. My life seems to be one long series of misunderstandings, mis-timings and half-baked attempts which send me backsliding to the introduction again.  Thanks for reading.

I haven't really been that bothered about what they have on file about me, or who knows that I have had difficulties - so what? I try to see things from the perspective of helping with stigma if I tell people my history as well. I don't advertise it; I don't wear a T-Shirt saying I'm mad, although my friend gave me a T-Shirt that says 'I hear Voices, & they don't like you either' lol. I haven't worn it.  In a just, open, & as free as possible society, where there wasn't discrimination - then people with MH problems would get as much sympathy & concern as anyone else with an illness. I look at the stories about cancer sufferers - 'heroic fight with cancer', & a picture of someone in bed with a bald head smiling, surrounded with friends & flowers. I know it isn't all like that, & I'm not glamorising that horrible disease. But I don't see many stories about heroic schizophrenics or heroic depressives, & everyone stood by them, with smiles & flowers.  There is this underlying current of mistrust, contempt, & general animosity towards the mentally ill - I don't need to explain what it's like - you know how it is. Like these conditions are something to be ashamed of - as weakness, as defective & weak willed persona, & constitution. Like we are infected with some kind of infectious & hideous condition, & need to be ostracised, put down, ignored, & forgotten about.  I know that there are good people out there that do care. & I do have some good friends that accept me for who I am. But in general there is this attitude of revulsion & disgust towards the mentally ill. I have a friend who drinks, I argue with him a fair amount, he goes on at me, that I go on about my MH problems all the time, which I don't. But he thinks I shouldn't talk about it at all, that if I didn't tell anyone then no-one would know, which they probably wouldn't, due to my functioning. But I say to him - why is it something to be ashamed of? Why should I not talk about it?  I see a lot of the problems with a MH difficulty, not so much in the condition itself; although that can obviously be devastating - But rather in the attitudes of society, the lack of care, the abysmal services, the poor & ineffective levels of healing & treatment, & in the massive amounts of stigma & discrimination. People in my life, & my life changed when I was labelled 'paranoid schizophrenic' - I have lived more on the fringes since then. Since I was labelled with this, I've not had a girl friend, not worked, & felt socially excluded from the wider society. There are multiple reasons for why things have been that way, but a large reason I think, is the largely unspoken stigma - the general attitude that schizophrenia is like some kind of foul leprosy.  I had gotten away from psychiatric services a number of times, I was quite good in the past of escaping from them. After the first admission I was discharged for 4 years, then after the next contact I escaped for 2 years, then after the next admission I escaped for around another 3 years. I have been back under the LMHT again for the past 4 years. This is the longest time that I have gone without being discharged. It wasn't that I was well in the past when I ceased to have contact, it was that I hated them, & wanted out from anything to do with them. I finally reached a stage of realising that it was better to have some kind of contact with psychiatric services; due to my record of having been so ill so often, & some horrible experiences of being very ill & having no contact at all with any services whatsoever - even a GP surgery. It got to a stage of realising that I couldn't just blank out the past & move on as a 'normal', as if nothing has happened. This stuff takes it's toll.  Instead of pushing stuff to one side & just getting on with things, I eventually had to realise that the mental illness issues weren't going away; & such things were the story of my life. I could no longer block stuff out like I once had done. I can't not talk about this stuff, & my experiences with MH. It's why I go on-line so much as well.  Sorry - I wrote a book"

Thanks for replying to my post and giving me the information about your own experiences. Your comments were chunky and juicy too!  On balance, some kind of contact with health services, even if it's only your GP, is a sensible thing to do. I agree on that one.  It's a big stigma and it won't go away overnight. Maybe some of us in the MH system will always be regarded as fakers or shirkers or just plain useless so far as the needs of government and society are concerned. I get this crap from members of my own family and the few friends I have. Sometimes, they don't even need to actually say it.  I've got a diagnosis of Recurrent Depressive Disorder which can be sort of scary and frustrating because the recurrence seems to occur when I'm under any kind of serious threat, both real or imaginary.

At least you still have some hope. Sorry if this sounds corny but I have to cling to the possibility of change and I hope you do also.  Jamesdean: points taken. Please believe me, I don't think I'm above people with mental illness and I realise that there are no guarantees against the ravages of the DWP or BA (which is it these days anyway?). I have a lot of sympathy for those who have negative Mental Health experiences like mine but it would be unrealistic and naive to say that i get on with all of them.  I mix with people who have all kinds of Mental Health difficulties and there are times when it all becomes ridiculous.  I'm supposed to be a visual artist and once heard someone say that artists are always up their own arseholes. That can be partly true. But it could be a major source of creativity. The sun can shine out of it too. I know she can be hard going, not for the faint hearted and full of long words but Dorothy Rowe wrote about something like this in her seminal book on depression.

Trying to rest and relax is best thing to do if you can manage it.  My apologies for the delay in responding to your reply. Like you, I am also trying to deal with a lot of anger which I habitually turn in on myself because I'm afraid of the consequences if I were to suddenly display it to others in an uncontrolled way.  I suppose I was testing the water and being provocative. Always a bad idea because I find it hard to take criticism. I know I can be extremely irresponsible in many ways and try to console myself by saying that I'm ill. Which I suppose I am because I feel so much emotional pain. As a man who labours under the diagnosis of 'recurrent depressive disorder', I find it frustrating that I can't seem to progress any further with my recovery and keep on repeating the same old mistakes time and again.  It's hard to explain.  I've tried to help people at the daycentre I attend, but it can be so demoralising. I have to remind myself to keep my arrogance and anger in check when confronted with people who seem to be playing some kind of obstructive game which I can't, or sometimes don't want to understand. I don't know whether MH difficulties can be attributed to poor communication skills, poor education or just bad luck.  However, I respect what you say about doing your bit. In a wider sense, I know there are many people with far worse circumstances than mine and I do try to keep this in mind.  Sorry to hear you've had negative experiences with Mental Health Services. I get so pissed-off with some of these so-called 'professionals'. Some I've met seem to be incompetent or poorly trained. They don't seem to take the job seriously enough. Some of these young girls who train to be Occupational Therapists act as though they are still at school and the unfortunate MH service users they deal with are just material for a good laugh over a glass of wine in the pub.  I had my first meeting with a new consultant today and came away feeling completely miserable and forlorn. Keep taking the tablets and see me in two months. Bloody useless. After making a few statements about my personality type and asking a big question I could never answer without careful thought and reference to personal papers, he probably has me pegged as a patient who lacks insight.  No wonder we get angry and then get labelled mad.  Sorry for going on JD. I just have to get some of this off my chest somehow. I know it's all me me me and I know how irritating that can be at times. If you've managed to read it, thanks.  All the best and take it easy."

Despite how that comes across, I don't think that it's far off the mark. Mental Illness is far higher in poverty groups. I missed a large amount of early schooling. But I wonder how much of it all is 'chicken & egg'. If you weren't in relative abject poverty when you became severely mentally ill; you certainly have a good chance of ending up in it.

No wonder we get angry and then get labelled mad.  If we are perceptive; then isn't it the same for almost all of us?  I have taken to writing reams of stuff before each psychiatrist appointment & mentally preparing for weeks before hand. Sometimes I give them what I have written, & other times I don't. Quite often I write them letters after the appointment. I have got so used to not being listened to, & having had so little 'orthodox support' that it has had this effect. I try to pre-empt what the psychiatrist will say. Like you, I can't answer a lot of stuff without careful consideration & often a lot of thought about things. A lot of things don't come to me until after.  I do wonder how all this writing makes me come across with them, but I am compelled to do it. I suppose it makes me appear quite mad sometimes. But the truth is that I am mad, & whatever the actual & original problems were; I feel that I have been driven more mad, in a different way, by life, by society, by the system, by people, by psychiatrists, by the MH services, by the tablets; by the whole bloody thing."

However that was changed tp dysthymia with super imposed depressive episodes but I dont honestly believe that covers the depths of experience of mh, to me just call it clinical depression n be done I was all for accepting the latter diagnosis but the psych was such a bitch I have questioned her though leyt me tell you they all stick together in the establishment so to speak.  I'm pleased that you have opened up tortoise because each day is a nbew day n we just dont know whot that day will bring this forum is very interseting because you never know who you are going to meet and I'm plesaed that I have meet you sorry if that sounds corny Dont worry about your post being all about me me me I woudl say if you think you are going to like the forum then why not start a journal it can be so valuable to off load your feelings esp the anger.

But money dont really bother me though I have no fear of being stinking ritch and would welcome the prospect in my life I have to say that when some profesional, christian well do gooder tells you there is meaning in suffering its bollocks the only thing that I will go with is that on a good day I do feel special n important in this world on a bad day (Well juust read my journal). Though I acccept that God didnt mean for suffering.  I wrote in my journal last night this meaning thing is crap I've kinda believed it a little of late but no its CRAP. (Say it like it is Frank)  I have just looked back at your post tortoise and read about others playing an obstructive game I dont think that possiably that some are I guess we are a cut above in so much that we are capable of helping others i personally had a clear idea of wanting to become a support worker this time last year it hasnt worked out but I think generalll y in the most in my life I do try to help others that are not so capable, though n I will be honest I will not be around people that have bad bo because I lived in hostels and there is always plenty of soap n water so there is no excuses.  I did visit someone at home n believe me the place was up to its neck though it didnt smell and this person is spotlessly clean, so it didnt bother me that there was just an edge of a armchair to sit on, I took comfort that this person gave me a nice glass of fresh orange juice and a chocolate bisiuit.

When I say something 'interesting' (in any negative way) to my CPN he scribbles it down....adding more weight to my file to be used both for and (potentially) against me. Labels and diagnoses don't interest me (and indeed I feel they are links in the chain that so many feel shackled by) beyond obtaining the support I need to cope/improve/recover. Yes, the file is now my alibi and I will use that for as long as I can - because it has become a reasonable witness to my difficulties. Telling people in simpler terms failed. Now I have it in black and white I am finally taken seriously.  Now that my mental health has improved enough to take me out of the 'crisis' zone I am feeling that even the 'misunderstandings, mis-timings and half-baked attempts' are drying up and I am facing the possibility of backsliding into crisis. Not because I consciously believe that that is where the support is (although I do think that) but because I am struggling almost single-handedly to maintain my recovery. Not very forward-thinking of them, really.  ""You look alright to me!""  ""Well, whatever.....I'll be back when I'm in crisis again then?""  Heroic depressives? Hmm...perhaps I have been fortunate....lately I have felt that I have 'impressed' people with my 'heroic' recovery. If I am not at least semi-recovered I am a disappointment and source of frustration.  As for girlfriends/boyfriends...(moobs or no!).....I think of something Henry Ford said...""Whether you think you can or you can't - you are right"". Personally I have no doubt I will find a new partner. Sure, it will be different now that I am a person with an even messier history but I still believe it will happen.  Positivity has been hugely rewarding for me in terms of recovery - and manifestation of other pleasant things in life. I had to have help reaching the stage where positive thoughts were even possible - that's the crux.  People don't always agree with me but I believe help is really only available when terrible things happen - which is why so many people are suffering MH problems for decades. Eventually, as with me, it may come to the point where the pot boils over onto the stove and someone gets scalded. 'They' then offer to treat the scalds and, maybe, mop up some of the mess. Surely it is easier for them to help watch some pots?"

Then, between Friday 16th and Wednesday 21st I had some of the worst depression and anxiety I have felt for a very long time, there were no breaks in it either. I was really worried about it. Then it started to lift. I have been feeling better since. That's one of the reasons I came off them, that's the sort of complication I can get into with psychiatric drugs. It worries me about taking them again, but I will wait until I'm back home from the Philippines before considering anything more. The doctor also wants me to take 2.5mg of Olanzapine with the Sertraline when I get back which is a very small dose of it. I don't know exactly why I get these problems with psychiatric drugs but every time there is a complication I'm more worried about taking them the next time. I can take other drugs such as pain-killers and antibiotics and caffeine etc. without any complications, but there always seems to be bad side effects with these drugs, I don't exactly know why."

Sometimes I feel like I'm 80 instead of 48. and I know people 80 with twice the energy I have. I tend to agree with you on the parkinsonian effects being tardive dyskenesia, it's possible the nurse was softening it up a bit so it didn't sound as bad. Out of the four aftercare nurses we deal with I do tend to like that one the best, she has been in psych care close to 3 decades and is very open with me and will pull strings to get the p-doctors attention if he isn't responding to appointment requests or taking my concerns seriously.

I think I'd rather put up with this than how I felt before, but I can appreciate it's a big problem for some people and we aren't all the same.  I do think you need to give psychiatric meds a while before knowing whether or not they're going to work for you though. And in my experience, it can take a while to know how you're going to feel without them after stopping, as your body gets used to not having them any more and you go through withdrawal.  I have experienced the restless legs problem on SSRIs, and still do from time to time (not sertraline though; I've never taken that). It's not as severe for me now as some people have mentioned, fortunately. If you have access to diazepam or something like it, that will probably help.

I haven't been taking CPZ for very long either, I've just started back on it after deciding that Olanzapine isn't right for me. CPZ or Largactil/Clorpromazine is a 1950s drug and it isn't given out so much now, but I find it seems the most reliable antipsychotic drug, it does tend to stiffen my walk up though, but there are tablets you can take for it although it still leaves me a bit rigid. It might be better to be a bit stiff in the walk than put up with the psychotic episodes which are also related to my depression. People don't take a lot of notice of my stiff walk anyway.

Sertraline is an interesting anti-depressant as unlike other SSRI's (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), it actually mildly boosts dopamine levels in the brain, but only to a mild extent. It does this more so than any other SSRI antidepressant. In some people this way contribute to insomnia.  While it has strong affinity for blocking the Serotonin transporter in the brain (increasing serotonin) it has a weak affinity for the Dopamine Transporter as well (increasing dopamine), whether it is strong enough to be clinically relevant is debatable, but no SSRI medication is purely selective just for Serotonin , they all have some mild affinity for other brain receptor types as well.  The nausea is caused by interfering with Serotonin levels in the stomach.  I have also been on Olanzapine for off label reasons and also have the massive increase in appetite than some other people have, otherwise it was a reasonable med for me.  The antipsychotic Abilify, iperhaps a suitable medication fpr some depending on diagnosis and other medical factors, tends to have less sexual side effects and weight gain compared to other atypical anti-psychotics. Because it is a partial dopamine agonist, I believe that is the reason it tends not to interfere with prolactin levels which I believe is related to loss of sex drive that can occur? I'm not an expert, something to quiz the doctors about.  When I was on Solian (Amisulpride) I had ZERO sex drive and it was noted my prolactin levels were raised. Switching to Abilify and suddenly my sex drive was back but then I went on Zoloft and I couldn't function sexually for several weeks.  In my case sex drive is not important to me as I am single and happy that way, but understandably sexual functioning is very important for many people.  Zoloft sexual functioning problems can go away in time, but it can take months."

I've been on these drugs and some of the side effects have been permanent, because basically it's what happened from experience. Please don't take the above as a criticism, more like a question.  When I was younger it was very important. Not purely by itself, but of a process of how I wanted to bond with women. But I never had much luck with women unfortunately, I went through great depression and indeed suicidal feelings about it. I don't know I just decided in the end for me the most important thing was to be loved by people emotionally. Watching other people with their relationships I saw a lot of the bad aspects of human sexuality, jealousy, sometimes exploitation, and territorial type behaviour in relationships. I guess I have seen a lot of bad relationships and fighting, and sure sex would be great in the appropriate context of a health loving relationship but for me, I don't know I guess it seems like the negatives outweigh the benefits.  Because i have problems with anxiety and stress, I view many aspect of having an intimate relationship as very intimidating and taxing, I like having my space and keeping relaxing. One time a very beautiful woman simply sat next to me and flirted with me. She was not seriously interested in me, I know, but was toying with me (mind games) psychologically and I almost have a full blown panic attack I was so intimidated.  I am not saying part of would not like sex, but I am more interested in the emotional bonding aspect of things. Sex to me I am sure it is nice and all, but it seems like your know eating a pizza, nice for a few minutes, then its over. I am not physically fit either I am not sure I could keep up of what is expected to me.  I am just happy how I am, I am not totally ruling out having a proper intimate relationship with a woman, but I am intimidated by the idea, and I have learned to see relationships as having lots of demanding strings attached to them and I don't like pressure.  I would never have casual sex, nothing against people that do, but I would want to feel very comfortable and morally appropriate about doing it in inside a commited relationship.  Maybe I shouldn't say this but I am a bit weird sexually, this is very embarrassing but I like women's feet and I am very scared of rejection via multiple levels.  I also see sex as something that causes many people to behave immorally, many of the people closest to me have been sexually abused or raped, and in my life I have in my life seen so many men (and sometimes women) treat people like worthless object to manipulate over the matter. I guess not trying to sound stuck up or anything but I believe in ""sexual morality"" to a high degree.  Probably way too much info to your question I don't usually talk about such things as I am very shy about such matter in real life.  Your right though that the side effects could be long term. I remember reading that exposure to SSRI anti-depressant in adolescent rats (I think it was) caused permanent alterations in long term sexual behaviour, and that is concerning.  Because its important to you, I certainly wish you luck restoring your sex drive etc. We are all different and have different priorities I guess, most people are fairly sexually driven, and I used to be full of hormones as a teenager, but not so much these days.  I am happy with how I am, and my self identity is esteemed on being a caring and conscientious person towards others and trying in my own limited way to make the world a better place (that is how I see myself as the person I want to be), maybe it would be nice to pride myself on being a handsome stud, but I am fat and I don't consider myself attractive."

I can relate to both those points very well, I think that relationships and finding one is a big challenge for everyone, much more so for someone with an illness which often means they don't always get one. I've noticed that I can feel paranoid just by watching the expressions on a lady's face, something that a very well person could deal with no doubt, but certainly a lot harder for someone who is ill. I think the later point i.e. 'I like having my space and keeping relaxing' is inevitable if you have been on your own for a very long time, anyone invading your space becomes a massive threat, i.e. we all tend to get stuck in our ways. I do have a girlfriend now after a very long time of being single, and to start with it was like the whole world had opened up and swallowed me, all I wanted to do was end the relationship, however, nearly a year later I'm use to it and like it. I've come off all my drugs and my sex drive is slowly returning, I couldn't even reach an orgasm or get an erection on the drugs, but 2 weeks later I can do both of those things again, thank God that's all I can say. I've had a very difficult couple of weeks since coming off the drugs though."

I needed my anti-depressant prescription. I outlined my treatment in very basic terms. I'm in private psychotherapy and the GP sorts my meds now. She didn't even ask me how I was doing [really really well, actually, I'm the most well I've ever been, sure I'm not sleeping great atm, but that's understandable given my recent move] and said she would read my records and then decide whether a referral to a psychiatrist was needed. You what? There are so many people out there who need it. I don't. And she didn't even ask me how I was really doing, didn't give that space at all. Just made some pre-judgements.  I don't know what to do. Mind say I could refuse a referral if she decides to go ahead. But I've always had an excellent relationship with my previous GP. I don't want to get a bad rep or anything.

I've found it doesn't work too well...  There's been no communication from the psych and I've been left with a private therapist treating the issues I thought important and the psych banging on about issues that he assumed were going on, that weren't. I found that the psych held the balance of power and could diagnose despite not having any information or feedback from my therapist. I found this unsettling.  After a year of these mis-communications, I told the psych this week that I wasn't going to continue with him. I doubt my GP will be impressed when he finds out, but I'm afraid it's tough! If a psych is doing you no good what's the point in tying up his time and resources, particularly if he decides to diagnose without knowing the full story.  A bit like you, i have found the ""system"" a bit controlling / bullying and this has set me back time after time. It might be me, but I like a bit of control over my health care...it reassures me and settles my anxiety. The system has let me down three times already with my physical and mental health....and I'd rather pay for what I need.  I would say a firm no-thankyou from the start and impress on her that there has been great improvement and that you will let her know if things deteriorate. Ask her if she would like updates or communication from your therapist if you are prepared to offer this and ask him to write her a letter outlining progress and treatment.  I've told my GP that I am getting better treatment without the CMHT and that if things get difficult - suicidal or other conditions arising - I will report this and take treatment as he suggests (within reason). At the end of the day they worry about accountability, so tackle that side of things and you will probably come to a compromise.  Would this work for you too perhaps?"

It sounds super overwhelming, the thoughts alone, then work and basic life on top of all those thoughts. It's a lot. I'm really sorry you're feeling this bad and hope that you find the forum a helpful place to vent and get advice from people who relate. Not being able to sleep for a variety of reasons seems to be one of the main struggles of most people on here, whatever they are dealing with.  I am overwhelmed by such basic things in life right now, not even working presently and feel it. The worries can just come at you from every angle until you feel like you never have your ""guard down"" and that's exhausting. I've tried every sleeping pill, etc. out there, and what ended up working for me was, and I know it's weird, listening to hypnosis for sleep recordings. Knocked me out.  But like @albagobragh said, if you can try to make a mental or physical list of daily things you want to accomplish, cross them off each step and pat yourself on the back for each and every step you take to make it, it helps. I have to do this even with the smallest steps I take to make it through the day without feeling really bad about myself all along. We have to try to be kind to ourselves, even if you have to fake it initially or for a while, it helps. This has been an exceptionally stressful year just in terms of the pandemic and social stuff, so remind yourself that you need to be extra easy on yourself.

Hi @Miguel thanks very much for that message. You have no idea how many times throughout the day I read it.... YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! "" If things don't work out it´s not the end of the world. Life take weird turns, you might end up finding something else that is more meaningful to you or you might realise a position with less responsibility is better for you."" These words really inspire me so really thank you I'm a very emotional person in general and take things personally and also my current personal circumstances are not great either which is probably why I mainly focus on my professional life. I'm gay and single for quite a long time now. I am doing lots of things on my own and I'm kinda fed up with this. I'd like someone to cuddle, to speak to be understood and do things with them... I'm using apps to meet people but looks like this is not working for me (don't find the right people there or probably I'm to ugly or too much of a weirdo). So things generally are not that great at that time and I sometimes I feel leaving my current job, the city I'm in this will change my life and probably make me happier (I DO KNOW THOUGH WE ARE THE ONES WHO CAN CREATE THAT REGARDLESS THE CITY WE ARE)"

I'm using gay apps so I can date people but nothing really happens. I'm matching with people but they don't talk to me and even if they do, they don't want to meet up or make any effort whatsoever! I really don't understand gay people nowadays: they are interested only in having sex and nothing meaningful BUT weirdly enough they all crave for a relationship without really making an effort and giving the opportunity to others!!! I'm chatting to people, organise to meet them and they just disappear with no excuse! I feel I have really tried everything in the past i.e. meetups, live flirting, gay apps but nothing really happens. I do consider myself as a handsome guy, well-educated and successful professional but in my personal life I'm a real failure (this is the way I feel). There must be something wrong with me (this is the way I feel sometimes at least) that I'm not able to meet my other half. I'm fed up doing things on my own and keep trying to date/ meet people. Today I met a big group of friends and most of them were couples so I felt really bad because I was on my own. Also, most of my close friends have now their own families, getting married, having kids etc so I'm also excluded from them because I'm not their priority anymore and that makes sense. I believe life for gay people is really unfair I feel like god is ""taking revenge of us"" because we are different and simply born that way! I am doing psychotherapy but don't think it really helps that much. Any ideas/ piece of advice from people with similar experiences? Thanks a lot"

I drive, I own my own home at age 21, I've been in committed 5 year healthy relationship, I am training to become an accountant, I go on multiple holidays per year and have a circle of friends. Everything sounds great, but I'm miserable. I'm miserable by my job and money.  Since my first week at work 3 years ago I have been miserable. I dread every week and only live for the weekend. I can't live like this! I'm in my 20s, they're meant to be the most exciting times of my life. Everyone my age around me seems to not really do much with their lives. They all still live at home, don't pay towards any bills, work part time and just chill. So it makes it upsetting to see myself working 8.30 - 5.30 Monday to Friday plus having to spend hours in the evening studying. I don't even earn very well currently and my salary is only set to increase by £2k when I finish my exams in a few months!  All my life I have been so indecisive at what I want to do. I have thought and looked into many options, from teaching, to beauty, to law, to police officer, to midwifery, literally everything! I get excited about these different jobs, and then a week later the excitement wears off and I'm back to square 1 with not knowing what to do. I have been trying to look for other jobs recently, but nothing is particularly eye catching and it would mean starting from the bottom again, plus most of them I have to commute for. A few months ago I finally settled on becoming a flight attendant, and I would still love to do that now. I spoke to a flight attendant in depth about the role so I know everything about it and it all just aligns with who I am and what I want to do, but covid!! Also the fact that I would be taking pay cut if I became a flight attendant which makes me anxious about being able to afford my bills.  Added to that, I currently work from home due to covid but with the covid situation gradually improving I am probably going to be back to working in the office within the next few months and that gives me huge anxiety. The fact that I have never really clicked with my colleagues coupled with how I fallen out of touch with my social side since lockdown began almost a year ago gives me so much anxiety.  I have felt immense pressure from my dad career-wise, but since he has seen me miserable he has seemed to change his views and now says I should do what I want and what will make me happy. But it's hard to do that now because I have fallen into the trap of being in a secure, reputable job which makes it even harder for me to leave to try new things in case the new thing doesn't work out.  I just feel miserable, hopeless and don't know what to do. I'm at the point where I feel I will never be happy."

I hate to influence you but if you are that unhappy with where you are I would make the changes you seek. You are young enough to be able to try new things and afford to fail sometimes. If the stint as an airline attendant doesn’t work out you can always go back to accounting, right? These kinds of decisions, ultimately, are adult decisions that adults make every day. It’s nit easy to place priority on security vs a chance at happiness and the choice is yours to make. I would consider if you were older which choice would you regret most and possibly make your decision based off of that. It’s scary to think about but you can make the right choice for yourself. You just have to decide to commit to one or the other. Good luck! xo, j"

Last year I went through quite a bit of therapy and also tried different anti-depressants, I also stopped drinking alcohol and took a step back from some unhealthy relationships, but I still feel like nothing I do is working or that I'm still just suffering/recovering from everything that's happened.  I'm not really sure where to start. There are quite a few tangible things that I'm unhappy/anxious about. Like finances, the fact I'm nearly 30 and not where I want to be etc.... but sometimes I get so upset and cry over other things too.  I think the main thing is how lowly I think of myself. One big thing that happened last year that sort of catalysed a bit of a mental spiral, was being unfairly treated by a group of unhealthy friends that I've known since high school. There were ups and downs over the years but overall the vibe in the group was always off. They bullied me for months in high school when I came out, and there has been other things over the years. It felt like as soon as I stood up for myself last year, it all just hit the fan and I still got blamed as if it was my fault I felt that way. My closest ""friend"" in that group, after a few months of radio silence after I stepped back, sent me a long message basically saying that she needed me, that she relied on me for her happiness. I replied by saying I needed space and time to figure things out, and she responded by accusing me of gas-lighting her before blocking me. I still, on a daily basis, go through this in my mind to the point of driving myself crazy.  I feel like my confidence and self-esteem are at an all time low. There have been other thing I've experienced over the years that have contributed to this. I refuse to be a victim and I hate to sound like I'm complaining, but sometimes this feeling is just too much. That group of friends aside, I was more or less consistently bullied/teased all throughout primary and high school. There was also an incident later on in my life where I experienced some online shaming that really pushed my anxiety and paranoia into overdrive. I have quite a supportive family, but even with them I'm constantly talked down to like a child. Also, when I tried talking to them last year about what I was going through with that friend, they all took her side and patronised me, as if I was being over dramatic. THey also didn't really seem to get why I stopped drinking, and the fact both my parents are borderline funcitoning alcoholics didn't help.  I sometimes feel like I genuinely hate myself and can't stop crying. I barely feel like a man and feel more like a child. I feel like because I've always had such overbearing, boundary-less relationships I have no idea who I am, and it has caused lots of confusion in my life, even with things like figuring my own sexuality out.  If anyone has any guidance or advice I would be really grateful. Thanks if you took the time to read this, as I said, I really hate moaning or complaining but I feel like I have tried so hard to push past this and I can't."

If you wish to challenge your current view of yourself, you will need to develop a different one. This is important as you will probably find (like many of us) that the past does not really go away, but can erupt into our lives at any time - bringing with it all the unresolved feelings to do with issues that we can do nothing about (i.e., as we cannot travel back in time and change things).  Another reason this is important is that people around us often want to 'keep us where we were', especially when things are not moving forwards for them and/or when they have been able to use us as a waste bin to dump their emotional rubbish in, or as a target for their anger, pain, disaffection, etc."

For example, over the past year I've stood up to my family a lot more and I can sort of sense that they are not used to it, in the past I've always just done what I was told. Also, with that friend I mentioned in my original post, she made lots of comments about me having my own life in a new city, having a boyfriend, and hanging around with people more than her that just seemed like she was jealous of me or didn't want me to be happy.  I do get what you mean about trying to move on from the past. I have been trying that to an extent, especialy things like stopping drinking because it has fundamentally changed my social life and lifestyle and I've put my own future and mental health first. Sometimes it just feels like there is soooooo much stuff in my past that brings me down. Almost to the point where it is really hard not to feel sorry for myself, even though I hate doing that."

Three lessons I have learnt (the hard way), are:  It takes a passage of time plus investing in and internalising new experiences to start to dilute 'stuff' when there is a lot of it. It is all too easy to be drawn back into stuff from the past unless their is a counterbalance to help defy the pull of gravity it can project. There are no quick and easy fixes - one has to be prepared to continually move forward in order to lessen the impact of the past."

Some of us put way too much importance to what people think and say and we feel guilty for not being there or being too assertive. But sometimes, it is important to be assertive and take risks with relationships. Glad you did it. No, don't feel bad for what has happened and as @Aurelius has so beautifully detailed it - start replacing your old memories with new ones - that's one way to start forgiving yourself. I know it's easier said than done but that's the only way the brain overcomes past trauma and learns to appreciate life again."

There was also an incident later on in my life where I experienced some online shaming that really pushed my anxiety and paranoia into overdrive. I have quite a supportive family, but even with them I'm constantly talked down to like a child. Also, when I tried talking to them last year about what I was going through with that friend, they all took her side and patronised me, as if I was being over dramatic. THey also didn't really seem to get why I stopped drinking, and the fact both my parents are borderline funcitoning alcoholics didn't help.  I sometimes feel like I genuinely hate myself and can't stop crying. I barely feel like a man and feel more like a child. I feel like because I've always had such overbearing, boundary-less relationships I have no idea who I am, and it has caused lots of confusion in my life, even with things like figuring my own sexuality out.  If anyone has any guidance or advice I would be really grateful. Thanks if you took the time to read this, as I said, I really hate moaning or complaining but I feel like I have tried so hard to push past this and I can't. Click to expand...

It's not been easy and now I cannot avoid it any longer. It's creeping in too much and I can't ignore it. I have never been myself. I don't know who myself is. It almost feels like I was never born. Instead there is this odd creature, which scans everything around her and tries to make sense of it through filters of insecurity, anxiety, mistrust, jealousy and possession. I have never been spontaneous. I always conceptualise and overanalise before taking any decision and acting on things. I lie, because I have no real personal opinion about anything; there just isn't a 'I' in me who can have thoughts and truly feel anything for real. I am and have always been a spectator of my own life, or rather it's like I am watching this thing taking over my life and the little me, deep inside, is constantly crying because it cannot exist. I have never truly been able to relate to anyone, expect maybe my sister, instinctively. I have had many friendships, most of them short lived and extremely passionate. I literally suffocate the other person until there is nothing positive left from our relationship. If the person is male, it gets very very awkward. I analise every word, every action and I know that the other person(s) can feel this. I meet this person recently. I found him to be very kind and very interesting. I wanted to be his friend. It started off well. I wasn't thinking too much about it. He came to me. And now I act like he's my possession. I am completely aware of it and yet I cannot stop myself or even hide it very well. I have scared him away and it feels very painful. He is truly a great person, with experiences so different from mine. I only wanted to know him better. Nothing more. BUt it wont happen and I feel like I will never, ever be able to relate to anyone for real. I get too intense. I am too insecure. I can't take decisions for myself and at the same time, I am authoritative. Life is not worth living without relationships (of any kind). I know I have had the potential to relate to someone, so I wonder: why was I born? What is this cruel irony which puts a creature on Earth which is not able to integrate and even physically adapt to its environment? A lot of the above is related to events which happened when I was younger. My family is very, very closed. Until very recently you couldn't say how you felt. My mother is bipolar. We were not allowed to upset her. I never said anything to my parents, or anyone else. I just went through the motion. And now I am completely and utterly empty."

I wish I had known sooner to have a chance to investigate, for example when I was a teenager and there were still people around to care.

You're right trombone, if there's one thing positive it's the fact that this forum exists, where one can be more truthful than in 'real' life. I do not want to see a GP. The last thing I want is chemicals to make things better. The other day (quite a while ago) I went because I wanted to get something against excessive sweating (always suffered from it), and she tried to give me antidepressants under the pretence they could help with sweating; excessive sweating is listed under the side effects... Therapy sounds like an answer, but I am neither ready to admit that I feel, hum I can't even write it, like I could give up on life all together? (which would lead me to some kind of NHS therapy) nor can I financially afford to get therapy from my own initiative. I have some knowledge of psychiatric treatments and it simply does not work. Meds placate you, but they don't cure you. My mother has been on them all her life, and she's never been ok. She's never ever had a psychiatrist who was truly willing to listen. And she can't afford to go to a psychotherapist, since she has to pay even though in her country she is recognised as handicapped from her mental condition. We do not live in a system which allows for personal growth and mental wellbeing on the state. It is considered frivolous. You can get help if you fit some criteria of obvious near-death, in situations where it would actually be impossible for the people to justify not helping you. I don't fit that profile. There's no solution. I could win the lottery. Or live like a zombie on drugs. But in reality, you know what's left."

It's unfortunate that a doc tried to give you ADs for excessive sweating, does sound like a crazy plan, cos I know myself that they can make that problem worse! I still think you need to see your GP with your original post (perhaps a different doc in the same practice if you have lost confidence in the other one), say that you would like to try therapy rather than drugs. The doc can then refer you to the local mental health team for assessment. Again, you can write everything down and show it to them.  Incidentally, I know all about scaring off friends by being too intense, I've been there too many times. I find someone who seems to understand me and I just don't want to let go...to the point of obsession. It's too much to bear sometimes isn't it?"

The following may help, or it may not. But what you said reminded me of certain things. I watched this series of 'U-Tube' Videos recently -  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJZDiUF-hXs  Michael Tsarion - Subversive Use of Symbolism (1 of 11)  There are 11 in the series.  Pt 2 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQoWbizsbc8&NR=1  Pt 3 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF6rfZ_zPv4  Pt 4 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Rj6JQ4Mpg  Pt 5 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hod_oEc9sKY  The general gist of it is that symbolism & very powerful techniques are used in the mass media, advertising, & in the societal influences that we are exposed to every day. This is not a new idea.  A lot of how we feel is very much influenced by our environment. We are impacted greatly by things that most people have little to no awareness of.  I don't think it surprising that so many people are so messed up; simply because they live in a Westernised Culture.  Personally I have found it helpful to try to have as much awareness of things as possible. I hardly watch TV, I question main stream media, & try to have as critical a mind as is possible. There are a number of ways of finding out & looking at the many ways in which we are manipulated, controlled, subverted, influenced & psychologically altered.  Anyway; as I said - it may help to look at this angle - or it may not?"

And in the meantime, try ringing up the samaritians, who are hopefully not only there to listen, bu tto guide you, and check upon you, t he following day.  A referral can take a matter of weeks, so I won't go down that route, particularly given what with the pandemic, and tiers, and lockdowns.

She was my best friends sister that I knew for years up until I was 9 years old as I had to move away so I lost contact with them all. Her and her 2 brothers were my best friends the only true friends I ever had. I always liked her since I was a kid and when I saw her in my doctors surgery I noticed she was looking at me a few times and I so wanted to go say hi to her but my anxiety held me back. So after I left my Doctors and went home I had a dream about her and my best friends and how it was back in the day, so I thought positive that I could look them up on facebook as I know there full names but I spent 2 hours searching online for them with no luck so it just really depressed me. I have no friends at all right now.  I have a photo that I took from my bedroom window when I was a kid when I was living with my foster parents and I kept it all those years its now hanging inside my closet and in that photo is a tree where me and my brother used to tell story’s about that tree and we always wondered what was beyond that tree but in 1993 my brother got adopted out and that was the last I saw of him. So a year later that was when I met these friends and that girl. That girl used to live in a house next to that tree and when I took a look at that photo, it was like the tree was telling me that shes the one and I'm starting to think that me and her were supposed to be hence the reason why I have always struggled to find love because love don't love me and now I feel like I've blown all my opportunities of maybe being with her when I saw her at my doctors surgery. I don't know if I will ever see her again now I'd like to have my old friends back too."

Basically, my partner has been having a very tough time for a while. She's constantly stressed, puts pressure on herself for everything, has been very negative for a long time, constantly talks about problems without really trying to find solutions, and cannot seem to get out of her negative loop. she also said on many occasions ""I can't deal with anything these days"" She's also very negative about her physical appearance, saying at every occasion that she's fat and ugly (when she's absolutely not). She now even turns nice positive things into issues and extra pressure. For example, I recently tried to be positive, and told her that just seeing her made me feel good, and she snapped telling me that this is too much pressure on her. Her work is also quite stressful. And with good reason as it's very badly managed. But she puts an insane amount of extra pressure on herself about that, ends almost every day exhausted, and regularly spends the whole week end locked in her room doing nothing and seeing no one to rest. She cancelled many plans for the week end we had, because she was too tired after the week at work.  She recently told me that she now wants to break up, even though she was lovely and cuddly just 2 weeks ago. I'm pretty sure this is because she feels guilty about our relationship. She said she feels she's not taking care of the relationship enough, that's she should be more available for me, that it's not healthy to be with her, and that ""I deserve better""  I've been concerned about her mental health for a bit, and wanted to slowly make her realize she probably needs professional help. I am not an expert, but looking at resources online, she exhibits quite a lot of symptoms for depression. I don't know if she's there yet, but I think she's getting dangerously close. I wondered if I should warn our friends and her family, but didn't want to put extra pressure on her, and wanted to do this with subtlety, and support her through bad times. With the break up now being a thing, I find myself out of time, and I really want to try and reach her before she completely isolates herself, and deteriorates even more.  What gives me hope, is that she is aware she's doing very bad, and mentioned needing to see a therapist on a few occasions. Except that her mindset has always been ""not now"" Also, despite the fact that she tries to hide how she really feels from our friends and her family, she seems to have always told me how bad she is. I recently asked her how she was doing, and her answer was ""I wanted to bake cakes, but changed my mind because I'm fat and I feel bad"" (she's an amazing baker, and usually loves baking). I obviously got concerned, and asked her if she wanted to talk about it. Her reply was ""I don't want to talk, I don't want to see anyone, I just want to stay in bed, do nothing and think about nothing"" I insisted a bit to try and get her out of her flat, and to talk, and she was surprisingly easy to convince after what she just told me. During our talk she said a few times ""I really don't want to be here"", and the talk was quite tense and negative overall (as we got a bit of an argument recently on top of things). But she still got out of her room, and came to talk to me without me having to insist that much. So I am now wondering whether this could be a cry for help or not ? I can't help but think that if she really wanted to hide this from me, she wouldn't have told me these things, and would have just declined my invitation to talk.  I am not 100% sure how to approach our next conversation. We're supposed to have a ""break up talk"" soon, and I want to take this opportunity to try and make her realize she needs helps, that all of her loved ones are here to support her, that she's making an already bad situation worse for herself, and has been for months now.  Any advice would be appreciated. I am also really considering warning everyone about this, but I don't want to do this behind her back, and would rather convince her to tell people herself. But if she doesn't want to, I won't just sit there doing nothing.  Thanks in advance for any insight or reply ! I can of course give extra details if things aren't clear"

I've suffered from depression, anxiety and low-self esteem since I was 12, I'm in my 30s now. I can be normal for many months - more than normal even - funny, sociable, happy, a joy to be around! Then a dark cloud seems to come over me for months and I hate myself, think about suicide constantly, often have intrusive thoughts of harming myself in horrible ways, thoughts that people hate me, people are laughing at me, think I'm a loser. I won't go out, won't talk to anyone, won't do anything.  I'm in my late 30s now and I have no career, I've just been going from dead end job to dead end job. I want to start my own business. I have the talent, finance, and time to do it but every day I get up and achieve nothing because I have no motivation to do anything. I'm living off an investment windfall from a few years ago at the moment, so I'm maybe not as driven by money as I would be otherwise but I have so much time on my hands! Time I had originally set aside to make this happen and I cannot make myself do it. I'm terrified of failure. I feel so awful about myself, I just watch tv all day, I avoid contact with my parents, siblings and friends because I think they think I'm a loser.  I have an amazingly supportive wife and a baby. I love my son to bits, but looking at his little face every day breaks my heart and fills me with guilt because I feel like I'm a waste of space, he'll grow up being embarrassed of me, it'd be better if I killed myself and he never got the chance to get to know me because I'm sure I will ruin his life because of my depression. I think he'd be better off with just his mother as she's a wonderful, positive person and I'm worthless. I feel guilty all the time about both of them having to put up with me.  I've been on Prozac for years, had many different therapists but nothing ever changes. How can I feel like I'm worth something and work towards motivating myself to achieve something? How can I be better for the sake of my child? I just really feel like things are not going to get any better ever."

1054,Depression Forum,371969,How do you motivate yourself when you have depression?,2021-04-20T19:06:08+0100,replier,False,89852,England,Zana,"Like yourself I have battled with depression since I was a teenager, about 15 years now. There's no easy way through it and no matter what one does, I don't believe it ever goes away.  About 2 months ago I stopped focusing all my thoughts on the future and how much pressure there was in order to have the best future possible. Instead now I focus on what I can do today and tomorrow to achieve a sliver of contentment. Then I hang on to that sliver like a lifeline. If one day doesn't work out, I make a commitment to myself that it is just a one-day blip and that it has no affect on tomorrow. I also dumped all social media and news which has been a real relief.  The most important thing seems to be acknowledging that you start by taking 1 step forward to 2 steps back, but with time, self love and acceptance, it will soon become 1 step forward to 1 step backward, and eventually 2 forwards to 1 backwards.  It's taking a lot of the above and ownership of my flaws to get even this far (regained weight I lost whilst ill, got my own place to live for the first time, eating routinely and exercising more), and I return to work in a few days after 2 months away so plenty of progress to come. By not being obsessed with what is to come and just taking small steps, it doesn't matter how fast that progress comes anymore.  Hope this helps and all the power in the world to you."

I've suffered from depression, anxiety and low-self esteem since I was 12, I'm in my 30s now. I can be normal for many months - more than normal even - funny, sociable, happy, a joy to be around! Then a dark cloud seems to come over me for months and I hate myself, think about suicide constantly, often have intrusive thoughts of harming myself in horrible ways, thoughts that people hate me, people are laughing at me, think I'm a loser. I won't go out, won't talk to anyone, won't do anything.  I'm in my late 30s now and I have no career, I've just been going from dead end job to dead end job. I want to start my own business. I have the talent, finance, and time to do it but every day I get up and achieve nothing because I have no motivation to do anything. I'm living off an investment windfall from a few years ago at the moment, so I'm maybe not as driven by money as I would be otherwise but I have so much time on my hands! Time I had originally set aside to make this happen and I cannot make myself do it. I'm terrified of failure. I feel so awful about myself, I just watch tv all day, I avoid contact with my parents, siblings and friends because I think they think I'm a loser.  I have an amazingly supportive wife and a baby. I love my son to bits, but looking at his little face every day breaks my heart and fills me with guilt because I feel like I'm a waste of space, he'll grow up being embarrassed of me, it'd be better if I killed myself and he never got the chance to get to know me because I'm sure I will ruin his life because of my depression. I think he'd be better off with just his mother as she's a wonderful, positive person and I'm worthless. I feel guilty all the time about both of them having to put up with me.  I've been on Prozac for years, had many different therapists but nothing ever changes. How can I feel like I'm worth something and work towards motivating myself to achieve something? How can I be better for the sake of my child? I just really feel like things are not going to get any better ever. Click to expand... I'm so sorry for your situation. I have severe depression, and I think it is impossible to will yourself to be motivated to any large degree. I think you can motivate yourself to a very small degree, such as taking a shower after thinking about it for hours, but not being motivated to the extent that a ""normal"" person can be motivated. It is a terrible aspect of this horrible illness.  One thing I do want to mention, though, is your saying the following:  ""I avoid contact with my parents, siblings and friends because I think they think I'm a loser.""  This is a very self-defeating attitude. I'm not an expert, but this sure sounds to me like the cognitive distortion of Jumping to Conclusions, which states that:  ""Without individuals saying so, a person who jumps to conclusions knows what another person is feeling and thinking.""  ""In particular, a person is able to determine how others are feeling toward the person, as though they could read their mind.""  ""For example, a person may conclude that someone is holding a grudge against them, but doesn’t actually bother to find out if they are correct."""

How do you motivate yourself? I read the following:  How to Motivate Yourself: A Summary  Getting motivated can be tough – and it can be even more challenging to stay motivated. In summary, here are 20 ways to motivate yourself: Just start and wait for the motivation to catch up with you. Break tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps. Create a positive mindset by asking yourself, “what’s good about this situation?” Create positive feelings by writing down three things you’re grateful for. Be kind to yourself when you make a mistake, then come back to the task at hand. Know that mistakes are a necessary part of progress – accept and learn from them. Cut overwhelming to-do lists down and focus on just one thing at a time. Let go of goals that overwhelm you and set attainable goals that energize you. Imagine your future if you don’t motivate yourself. Reflect on your past successes and use the positive feelings to stay motivated. Remind yourself of the reason why you want to find motivation to get things done. Remember the trade-off you need to make to get what you want, then commit 100%. Eliminate the things that distract you and then focus on one thing to achieve your goals. Tidy space, tidy mind – declutter and organize your space to help motivate yourself. Stay motivated by experiencing different food, music, books, or podcasts. Look to people in your life who inspire and motivate you. Ask close friends and family to help hold you accountable. Follow people who inspire you online. Listen – and dance! – to an upbeat song. Then dive into action when it finishes. Connect with your true potential – you’re more powerful than you think."

I'm hoping to ease your mind regarding your son.  So, my dad has been depressed for the majority of my life. He received shock therapy for many years, but hasn't needed them for about three years now. He spends a large portion of each day napping on our living-room floor because he doesn't want to miss out on family time, but his depression exhausts him-- or he needs an escape. The rest of the day, he spends scrolling through Facebook and youtube, and he watches movies at night. He has a hobby, but hasn't been able to work for a long time. He receives social security checks, as he is on disability. He goes to therapy and takes a cocktail of medications.  My first piece of advice to you as a father is to be honest with your son from the very beginning. Inform him from the very beginning. I held a lot of resentment and hatred towards my dad because he thought that it would be better to tell me that he was faking his depression-- so he wouldn't have to work a job. Therefore, I thought that he was just lazy and was happy to let my mom be the breadwinner, the housekeeper, and the tutor for our family. We lost the house because my mom couldn't keep up on her own, and I saw my dad as a person who would let this happen just because he didn't like working a job.  It wasn't until I confronted him one day that my idea of him was able to change. I was eighteen when I confronted him, and I was about fourteen when he had told me that he was faking his depression. He hadn't realized that that comment about faking it had made such a huge impression on me. It wasn't able to understand him until I saw him break down and sob about how miserable he was.  My second piece of advice to you would be not to kill yourself. This dude lives the same day every day: wake up, Facebook, news, Facebook, long nap, chores, Facebook, movies, bed. Nobody should look at their dad and see a profession, they should see a loved one. I had a fantastic childhood because of him. Whenever my car breaks down-- which has happened a few times-- I call home and know that he's there to pick up the phone and save me from the side of the road no matter what time it is. Also, my friends used to always ask me to ask him their pet questions, like why her gerbil wasn't drinking water or how to nurse a humming bird back to health. I was always so proud that he was my dad when this happened.  My dad has been suicidal a few times. I know that my life would not be better without my dad, so I'm thankful that he was able to come out of those moments alive.  I don't know how to motivate you. I also have depression, and have the same symptoms that you listed (anxiety, tendency to isolate, intrusive thoughts, insecurity, etc.). However, I think that I have perspective-- as a daughter of a person with major depression-- to know that your love and companionship as a father is enough!!!!!!!!!!   Ps. Have you tried Zoloft? I took Prozac for a while and it made me very sleepy-- and therefore unmotivated. I've had a much better experience with zoloft, as it's supposed to give you more energy. I'm still taking long naps due to a trauma that I'm still getting over, but Prozac made me sleepy before I even had a trauma lol. Wishing you the best!"

I do have some misgivings about taking anti-depressants but, I can't go on feeling how I do now and, I can't see what else is going to help (I'm seeing a counsellor but, even he said he doesn't think this will work alone). I do have a couple of serious concerns though.  I read this article about a guy who has, to say the least, been acting strangely (he threw a puppy at a group of Hells Angles and then tried to escape by hijacking a bulldozer). It says that is said to ""have stopped taking depression medication"". I don't know if he has other mental health problems too or, if it was the medication or, stopping taking it that made him behave like this but, I'm concerned that taking medication (or coming off it) might make me think or behave irrationally like that. Does anyone have any experience of anything like this while taking anti-depressants?  Also, I read on wikipedia that it is possible (although not proven) that there can be permanent side effects of SSRIs. In particular, that it may cause long term or permanent sexual disfunction (although it hasn't been well established that this can happen). I think that at the very least, this must be very rare. I also have no idea how they distinguish this from cases of sexual disfunction from other unexplained causes (since it is often difficult to find the cause).

1098,Depression Forum,8102,Did you cope with Christmas?,2009-12-26T22:13:12+0000,author,True,3933,London,Prince Buster,I have not been that fond of it the last few years and things are not so good at this time of year in my family.  My mum's father and brother both died close to Christmas and she always feels low at this time of year (she is bi-polar) and then my uncle left my aunt on Boxing day three years ago so the last couple have been dreadful.  Last year I pretty much opted out of it by working the whole lot but found I just spent a lot of time at home on myself so this year decided as I had time I would try and have a proper Christmas.  I ended up at my parents from the 22nd and was looking forward to it having bought nice gifts for everybody that I thought they would appreciate.  By Christmas Eve I was in a shocking state and spent the day in bed crying. I had nothing to do on the night and got very low seeing everybody out having fun as I took my sister to her boyfriend's house.  The actual day was OK although I found myself with little to do and got even more upset when my mum asked if being with her made me depressed.  I could not sleep very well last night and have been up since before 6am today - very unusual for me.  When I got home tonight (I had to leave earlier than I had intended to as I just needed to be home) I discovered a letter from work telling me my sick pay stops next week.  Sometimes I just feel like the whole world is ganging up on me. Apologies for the rambling nature of this post but I just needed to get it out. And I have had half a glass of wine.

If they do not welcome you or if they don't treat you good, then that is the time that you distance yourself. I believe your family loves you and wants the best for you even though they kept themselves distant from you because of your past mistakes. Become the best version of yourself.

The months afterward were very hard and they still are. I decided to try and meet someone else recently because of how lonely I felt. I've met several girls, one of which already had a boyfriend, the other said that I was 'too nice' after we had one date together. I really do miss having a girlfriend, someone to love so dearly.  I met a wonderful girl on a course I attended a month ago, she was already in a relationship to my dissapointment. She is in a long distance relationship and she told me that she wasn't happy. She told me how her controlling boyfriend couldn't care less about her and how he hasn't bothered to visit her in over four months.  We became very close and she told me that she was falling for me. I comforted her when she was upset, we talked for hours until midnight. We arranged to meet up and we did on Wednesday evening. At the end of the evening, we shared a very romantic kiss.  We kissed and it was one of the most amazing feelings that I've ever experienced. We hugged and kissed for a while and then held hands. After we said our passionate goodbyes, we sent messages until 2 in the morning. I woke up the same morning to a message that broke my heart, she told me that our kiss was a mistake and that we should forget it ever happened.  She told me that she likes me as a friend and that she loves her boyfriend. It deeply hurt me, I only wanted to comfort her but we both ended up falling for one another.

1203,Depression Forum,145616,Depression and anxiety...? Not sure what it is or how to deal with it.,2016-10-25T21:20:41+0100,author,True,57227,London,gia_85,"I'm writing this after my whatever-it-is has ruined things for me once again, and I really need to address it.  I was on my way to my second shift at my new bar job, and rather than entering the building when I got to the right street I stopped at the corner and couldn't go in.  I get this crippling fear which stops me in my tracks. It's like a wall coming down around me, or like being in a straight jacket, and my head goes a bit foggy and I can't think straight. No matter how much I try and make myself do what I should be doing, I can't get my body to obey and I end up shaking and freaking out. I could feel it coming all day, this heavy sinking feeling, this fear, so I kind of knew it would happen, but I tried to ignore it. I thought if I put my make up on and got myself there on time I could get past it, but it didn't work. Even though I know there's nothing to be afraid of, and not going in is the worst decision I could make, I can't make myself move. And the more I try to fight it, the worse it gets, until I find myself pacing around outside crying and taking deep breaths to try and calm myself down.  I'm so angry and disappointed with myself for screwing up yet another opportunity because of this. I missed my shift, turned off my phone (because seriously what do you say to your boss when he calls??) and walked the hour and a half home, contemplating suicide twice on the way.  The ridiculous thing is that I'm an actor, and with 90% of performing related stuff I'm completely fine. It's the small, pedestrian stuff that gets me. Like I'm so convinced that I won't be able to do the most basic things and I have a breakdown over it.  I'm tired all the time and I feel so hopeless. Leaving the house is a huge effort too. Not for everything, some things I can manage (again, acting-related stuff is fine) but sometimes the fact that I have to get dressed, put on make up, leave the house etc. just seems like the most enormous task.  I have suffered from depression on and off since I was a teenager (I'm early 30's now) and I also used to suffer from an eating disorder, but this crippling ""anxiety"" (I don't really know if thats what it is) is the thing that really gets in the way of my life. I've either quit or been fired from several jobs because of it. How can I possibly have any sort of life if I can't even hold down a minimum wage job? Unless I become a successful actor (hahahaha) I literally don't know how I'm going to live.  I'm terrified of telling people in my life because I honestly believe they'll just think I'm a lazy cow. Although when I email my boss later I think I'll just have to be honest with him, tell him I had some sort of anxiety-related meltdown, apologise and tell him I'm going to get help.  Has anyone else experienced this? What is it, what causes it and how on earth do I get past it?"

I'm pretty sure it's a form of anxiety. I get it quite often but it effects me differently.  I feel as though something terrible is going to happen all the time. Like if a car goes past I'm going to be the victim of a drive by (the police don't even carry guns where I'm from).  It sounds mental and I wouldn't tell people this is how I feel. It can result in me wanting to shut the blinds and hide away from the world. I've done this in the past but it's not the answer.  Sadly, when I've sought help previously I've never brought it up through fear of judgment. I'm determined to get it sorted though and I hope you can to.  Sorry this wasn't the answers you were looking for but you're not alone. Sometimes a bit of reassurance can help, that's how I feel anyway."

I can't get out of bed today, I have work to go to but I feel like I can't face outside. I feel like my body is paralysed. My alarm went off more than two hours ago and I can't get up even though I'm busting for the toilet. Everything is grey, my head feels foggy, I feel failure, chronic back pain, heart burn from the stress of everything, sadness.  I feel anxious about having another sick day from work, shame of telling my boyfriend I'm still in bed when he has already left for work and commuted into the city.  I try going one step at a time. Go to the toilet, brush teeth, wash, dress, breakfast, medication, emails. Everything split into short and easy tasks. But I can't, I feel like it's all too much and I need to stay in bed and hate myself for what I'm feeling. I'm usually strong enough to do the above but sometimes, like today, it feels so bog and takes over me.  I can't go outside, I can't put on a smile and act normal and resilient at work.  My boyfriend is like 'nothing is wrong, why are you sad'. Nothing is wrong but I can't change what I'm feeling. It's scary to wash and feel the water on my skin. It's too much to find clothes to wear and pull them on. It feels frightening and that's not rationale.  So I'll stay in bed today :/"

I left for two months to start a new job. However, I found the new job – it was a very toxic environment. Management talking about other staffs confidentiality in the office. Gossiping about others. I was still covering overtime shifts for my old workplace via going over my work hours resulting into working 58 hours per week. Which clearly showed I was dedicated to my old workplace. Two months into the new job. So I returned back to my old job.  The new job's management are working closely with my old management. So the link is there.  However, since I have returned back to my old job. I have found my old management have changed and in fact I have experienced workplace bullying.  On my first week of returning back to my old job. I noticed my Team Leader was always on the phone having conversations with the manager of the project that I just left. Some of these conversations were outside away from me.  My current Team Leader chose to put me on weekends working with another colleague whom I don't get on well with. So I informed I was feeling anxious about this and we met for a meeting.  I was absolutely shocked because what I turned to her for support and instead experienced in that meeting – was bullying. It clearly showed the bitterness and anger that was coming from the manager of the project that I just left from.  Some of the bullying I experienced in the meeting:  “That I should speak to my GP and seek counselling” after I explained that I was feeling anxious about working with another member of staff on weekends and working alone on same shifts as well after I explained and provided examples on why I was feeling uncomfortable working with the other staff”  “Team Leader finds me patronizing towards another member of staff ”  “I jump from job to job too quickly”  “Why didn’t I notify the team leader first before the service manager on wanting to apply for the job that I just left”  “Team Leader is very surprised to see me come back to the project. Most people get at least 18 to 24 months experience and then move on. I’m coming up to being here for two years now. Team Leader is very surprised to see me back here. When I left, it was time for me to move on. What can I develop in the job now that I have returned”  “I should move on to gain further different experience within other services within the work company”  Team Leader informed me that she and another member of staff had agreed tension between I and previous SW had disappeared after I left the service” “I was using the old office at lot when working under the new service instead of working at the new office”  A week later I sent an email on what happened and copied her manager above her into it. I requested on why she said those things. She replied back saying she will talk to me in Supervision. This was four weeks ago.  In conclusion, I came to her seeking support as my Team Leader but since the meeting, I have felt low, intimidated and unwanted on the team.  The manager above her never replied nor did anything about it.  A week later, I requested via email to meet with my manager for Supervision. Again I copied in her manager so she is aware of it. We currently had two weeks remaining of the rota. The reply I got back was – she is waiting for the September rota to come out as she and I won't be seeing much of each other during the next two weeks.  I looked at her diary and she has nothing planned. There is plenty of time to meet with me. She has met with other staffs for supervision and I'm the only person who she hasn't met with. Again the manager above her has seen my requests and has done nothing.  My Team Leader has been avoiding me as much as possible. I have maintained my professionalism and doing my job.  I have joined unison but they say they can't offer advice as it's an on-going issue which started before I joined.  The meeting took place on 13/08/18. I have requested for a follow up meeting. I have been denied and ignored. The manager above her has done nothing. No means of trying to resolve this issue.  I feel I have done a lot to help the service when they needed it. Now I won't do any more cover and I'm looking for another job. But then I feel why should I leave when I fought so hard for the project.  Anyone got any advice please?"

Please don't suggest things like meditation, cardiac exercise..etc I already done them and no any improvement at all they seem to be common advices from people who havent experienced emotional numbness  What I'm asking for isn't advices on what could help emotional numbness in theory but I want to see actual people recovered from this symptom so I can get some hope/insight on how to recover too  I have done lab tests like testosterone, thyroid hormones.etc and they were all normal.

Bringing my pain to the forefront and letting it do the talking. My depression came off in layers and wasn't a simple straight forward process. I had to acknowledge my pain and respect it by allowing it the space to express itself. I had to respond to my pain the right way and give it the freedom it needed and allow all the healing to occur and this required going internal inside myself and purifying all the agony and what my pain was saying.  I had to see the beauty of things to reconnect and re-engage with life and appreciate it again. I had to have attitude changes and look at things differently to lose this nagging feeling of no interest in anything. I had to be positive and do positive things. I had to improve my self esteem and feel that I had a place in society and I was an important contributor. I had to remind myself that I have a purpose so I'm not lost floating in the wind.  Also remember that if you can improve your mood you will improve other layers of your emotional health including anhedonia. This is because mood is more than just being happy and sad. Mood also controls how optimistic you are, how willing you are to work on new projects, how forgiving you can be, your strength to solve problems and it even affects your energy levels. So improving your mood and developing an appreciation for life will combat anhedonia. It's something you have to work on.  Anything you work on and give attention to will eventually produce excellence. It's just like that neighbour who has the best lawn on the street because he gives it so much time. The same is with your moods. Losing depression and its associated sub symptoms like anhedonia is a process where things fall off in layers and they are connected in strange ways. It takes time and work.  I had to add more excitement in life. I had to look at things and really see the beauty in them. For example things that I've enjoyed since childhood like computer programming I lost pleasure in for a while but when I started hyping myself up and really discussing with my self what I could achieve if I learned it professionally, my emotions changed positively. I had to have reasons to motivate myself and motivation and the pleasure chemical dopamine are connected.  I basically had to reconnect with life even if it took time and force myself and really get into things. I had to appreciate life again. With small events of progress I would feel excitement and that really is the heart of this issue. If you can invite more energy and excitement into your life with this condition you're on the road to recovery.  One more thing. I had to stop seeing pain as an enemy but rather as a friend on my side who was expected in the circumstances and who's job was to push me back to comfort. He would stay around as long as he was needed and I had to change my attitude to pain if I wanted to get better. I actually felt excited about pain when I saw it in this light.  This is what worked for me."

Essentially it all comes down to energy. Depression and all its associated symptoms are just forms of low energy. Adding credits to stabilize the energy balance and increase it will head you in the right direction. In addition to this it's important to consider yourself holistically. Psychology and Psychiatry are two sciences that don't really consider the person as a whole which is what I think is contributing to the mental illness epidemic. They can be helpful (I personally prefer psychology over psychiatry) but as years have passed health has gone in this extreme direction where the inseparable has been separated. As an example, just recently I have realized why I couldn't get out of my head even though I knew I had nothing to worry about. In recent months I have been suffering from an onslaught of thoughts. This has recently stopped. Upon reflection it turned out that what was lacking in me was something to keep my mind occupied preferably something I'm naturally predisposed to be interested in. I have recently occupied my mind in such activities and the thoughts have stopped. My point in mentioning this is to highlight how one aspect of health even though it seems unrelated can impact the other and in fact benefit it.  When it comes to losing pleasure and interest in everything, you need to reignite the energy flow to be healthier. When this happened to me it was the beliefs in my subconscious restricting me from being happier and having higher energy levels. The thing about the subconscious is that it needs convincing. When you lose pleasure in everything at the root of it is a set of beliefs that say things like ""what's the point?"", ""there is no pleasure in this"", ""I'll never achieve satisfaction again"", ""life is boring"" and etc. Once those beliefs are changed naturally your emotions heighten (the energy balance starts to stabilize). Your spirits lift.  To change these beliefs you need to experiment and expose yourself to things. If you can, try to target the things that are established, by that i mean you already know you have found pleasure in them in the past. Even if it feels like crap at the start start exposing yourself and shifting away from this low energy state because at the start the goal is momentum. You need to notice and look for signs of excitement and interest where the subconscious can start changing the beliefs it has. This is a process and sometimes can be a one step forward two steps back thing.  In my own life I am naturally predisposed to get into high energy states with computer programming and computers. I am talented, gifted and interested in them. There has been a period of my life where I lost this interest and didn't find pleasure in it. When I re-engaged with it, done new things and saw myself doing things I couldn't believe I could do, more energy arose in me and my moods heightened. My negative beliefs in my subconscious changed and I started enjoying it again. The reason I mention energy is because it is such a deep concept. Your neurotransmitters are forms of energy. So doing something new, which is what I did, encouraged dopamine release which is a form of energy and is our feel good chemical. Achieving things and making progress probably released serotonin. So having a more positive energy flow flowing in my brain helped change things and is what I needed to encourage. You have to work at your stubborn subconscious because it can become stagnant and stuck and you have to make effort to re-convince it.  The reason I mention treating yourself holistically though is because if your health is deficient in one area it may impact your ability to get out of anhedonia. Take care of your entire health because they are interconnected like I mentioned earlier. Don't go to the extreme of isolating health to one dimension. Talk therapy has helped me incredibly and made me see things differently which has taken mountains off my chest but I also needed to supplement it with keeping my mind occupied in every day life or my mind would revert to being consumed by negative thinking. Also, start the effort and give yourself time. You need time with depression and its associated symptoms."

So there was forms of novelty, progress and achievement in it. This generated excitement and a change of beliefs/emotions. But you can also try novelty in things you haven't had an interest in before.  The main underlying point is to encourage a better energy balance in your life."

It's very interesting and there's a lot of truth in it.  I know, in my case, why I've eventually over the years lost interest in everything. It's all due to my chronic anxiety. It's worn me down over time (almost 40 years) and I just feel too stressed / scared / tense / full of dread to feel ""safe"" enough to enjoy anything. So eventually, I have come to feel like everything is unpleasant because (a) I'm too uncomfortable to enjoy anything due to always being anxious, (b) due to this, any perceived effort required to do anything I don't want to do anyway makes it even more unappealing, which (c) results in me being chronically bored, dull and empty. And still full of dread and fear.  For me also, it's connected to my physical interest in things. I never have an appetite anymore, and haven't for over 3 years. I just have no desire to eat. I used to LOVE food, going out for dinner, and looking forward to meals. Now it just bores me and is something else that's an obligation. (I DO eat. Only dinner and a snack later at night when I'm more relaxed)  On the very rare occasions that I feel physically hungry, I also tend to feel a bit more ""alive"" and interested in things in general, emotionally and mentally.  So like with everything else, chronic anxiety is the cause of my non-existent appetite. It used to be that when I was in a state of acute distress, I couldn't eat at all as my body was in a panic state. I wouldn't eat anything for days on end. Eventually it would fade and I'd be able to ""relax"" enough to eat again, but eventually, the relief stopped coming and my appetite was permanently pushed down.  I guess that makes sense though. No appetite for food OR for life."

I’ve put on weight since I’ve been eating depression medication so I ordered some bras online. They got posted to my house and a few days later I heard someone say whilst walking past my house you’re an A cup and then another guy say why don’t you buy new pants. It’s just too coincidental for things like this to keep happening to me. People walk past my house saying things that relate to me. Has this happened to anyone before???? Could the postman disclose my information to random people on the street of what he’s delivering to my house????

Some of you reading this will say oh your amazing and all the rest of it... yep I may be somewhat alright behind a computer typing and posting stuff and commenting but in real life I can guarantee none of you lot would want to know me if you met me because nobody wants to know me.  I don't know why I get so tore up about rejection but anyway I met up with some people from one of my hobbies which is metal detecting and afterwards that was that. They have been ignoring me they made a video for youtube but then deleted it because they didn't want me in it. I'm not a likeable person at all and I feel so sorry for those who have had the misfortune of meeting me it must have been very embarrassing for them. I'm not going to sugarcoat things because the truth is ugly in my circumstances. I will always be alone with no friends in life. I should have learned by now that I'm not like anybody else and yes I know other people have there problems but there is other people and then there is me and I'm on the outside of everything.  I hate rejection it gets me every time and its really painful I can't help but feel annoyed at myself by trying once again to make friends thinking that it be different this time... it never will be.  I'm a loser in life I will never have friends and I will always have to be alone and deal with it and make the most out of my life no matter how depressing my existence is.

It seems like you might have various shitty aspects about yourself, that put others off. One of those is probably just how little your value yourself. While an idea like ""I'm less than average."" can be correct, your attitude ""Nothing will ever go right."" will cost you the chances that remain. Chances will come up by, well, chance, regardless of how shit or good you may be. Take those as opportunities, don't let good things pass you by. Taking action will inevitably lead to social contact, and unless you deliberately fuck it up, you'll make contacts that might turn into friends. You can't tell exactly what the future holds for you, and ""never"" is as unrealistic as ""100%"". Don't beat your present up for a future that may or may not be there. Also, I'm not sure if this is unintentional but.. Jesus Christ you're such an attention whore. ""I'm a loser in life I will never have friends and I will always have to be alone.""

Actually, these psychiatric drugs seem to have dire consequences with me, I hear people say how good they are with them but I tend to end up feeling like a helpless baby, unable to do anything, talk to anyone, or function properly when I take any type of drug like this. On the other hand I get on much better with stuff like alcohol, I don't get adverse affects to that or nicotine etc., so maybe I'm a bit back to front. Can anyone relate to that? Anyway I'm dead scared of taking these, mainly because my sex drive has already been affected so much by what I think were psychiatric drugs. I don't want it killed off altogether, that's the last thing I want. Still people seem to have got on quite well with sertraline, so I hope I get some more replies. I took some risperidone last year for 3 weeks, and my sex drive was killed off for about 6 months before it started to come back again, so I'm worried about a repeat of that. Naturally I'm worried."

My boyfriend was right next to me but i couldn't bring myself to tell him how i was feeling. I dont know if it was the part of my mind that wanted me to die that was forcing me to keep it a secret but i dont know if i'll be able to ignore it if it happens again. Is there some way i can let someone close to me know im feeling suicidal without actually explicitly telling them? I don't know why its so difficult for me to say.
1275,Depression Forum,7917,talking about suicidal thoughts,2009-12-13T14:32:54+0000,replier,False,0,,telemetry9,There are times when I have told a good friend that I have been feeling suicidal. It seems to get it out of my system and takes some of the sting out of it. I don't care what his reaction is - I just need to get it out to someone.  I then move on to something else and let him know that because I have those thoughts doesn't necessarily mean I will act on them. I think he understands this now and doesn't need me to tell him that.  It's important for me to be able to do that with someone - but I think it depends on the relationship you have with someone. Perhaps it would be harder with your boyfriend. If you can tell him that you need someone to just say how you have been feeling without any major drama but as a vital disclosure - then that might work with someone. It's about what is right for you isn't it?

Most times I haven't felt like I deserved good in my life. When I'm mentally alone, I hurt too. I'm crying, scratching at the air, kicking the wall. But you're never really alone when you have yourself to talk to.  I find it easier when you're alone to come up with an imaginary friend like you did when you were a kid. It can be a vessel for your fears and desires and a substitute for affection when it is absent from your life. I have a pillow I hug and kiss in order to sometimes imagine myself in a romantic relationship. I talk to it, but have the presence of mind to know it's just a pillow. I've discussed things that bother me with my pillow and having support from it (essentially your kinds words filtered through it) you can become your own best friend.  I didn't want to love myself. I wanted someone to love me. But that wasn't happening. So I turned an imaginary friend into a therapeutic vessel for loving myself. It's been an incredibly helpful tool at times."

1299,Depression Forum,127324,I think I need help... Any advice would be greatly appreciated,2015-12-23T21:52:35+0000,author,True,49251,London,chefcurry,"Hi everyone,  I'm an 18 year old male at my first year in uni. I have been feeling miserable since my last year of school (I'd say since around Feb/March). To put a long story short, I hate myself and every day is becoming a struggle for me. I hate the fact that I've failed over and over again in every aspect of life regardless of how much effort and time I put into something. I feel like there is nothing to look forward to in the future, I have absolutely no drive to study or do anything productive all day. I go to bed at roughly 5am and sleep for 10-12 hours and even after that, I feel lethargic all the time. I thought uni would open me up to new experiences and I have tried to make friends in several ways but to no avail. I have no close friends or family that I can talk to (they just bring up religion and my 'lack of faith in God'...). I've obviously never had a girlfriend or done anything with a girl. Heck, I've never even had a female friend in general. I despise myself physically (not out of shape or anything, just a hideous freak). I feel so alone and isolated and like such a complete loser that I just want to drop out out of uni, but then what would I be doing with my life... I fail to see any kind of silver lining for myself. Some of my flatmates at uni are the few people I can get along with but even then, I find myself losing my temper with them over trivial things. It's not uncommon for me to cry for an hour or two before going to bed. There is one sport that I was extremely passionate about and would practice weekly, either alone or with others - it would never fail to alleviate my mental state. Now when I force myself to play, I don't feel anything. Just tired, because I hardly have enough energy in the first place.  I am scared of getting counselling or seeing a doctor because they may think my 'problems' are pathetic and trivial and might just tell me to man up or whatever... Sometimes I think the same and hate myself even more for it.  Someone please tell me what I should do or who I should talk to. I am so sick of life, many times I think I am just not cut out for it.  Thanks if you take the time to read my rambling."

Your doctor is not going to judge you and you are not pathetic at all. You are really struggling right now and the first thing to do would be to contact your doctor and explain the way you are feeling. I think you could really benefit from some therapy to work out the reasons for your struggles. Please do not think you need to 'man up'. You have ever right to feel the way you do and you cannot help it. There is support out there.

Obviously I can't make that judgement which is why it's important to see a doctor. They have heard all sorts before and you shouldn't feel embarrassed to totally open up to them. The things I've came out with to my gp and psychiatrist lol and they haven't blinked!  As for uni, I've been there. I took a year out in second year as I couldn't cope. I never thought I'd be well or good enough to go back but I did and I graduated with a first class honours degree (best you can get in the UK). So it's not a case of suffering through or giving up. You should be able to take time to seek treatment.  And I cried in front of so many advisors and counsellors at uni who were all really understanding."

I honestly can't physically control my bottled up anger and extreme sadness, I want to be happy so badly but I hate myself and my life for a variety of reasons. I'm considering seeing a GP but I don't know about counselling...  @ Freezingmoon - I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet because I have not seen any kind of health professional so far (not for mental health I mean). It's really impressive to hear you graduated with a 1st, that shows a lot of resilience and determination! I think I'm far too mentally weak and demotivated to even read a book right now, it would just seem like giving up would be the best option for me, because honestly I don't know how I'd react to disappointment and failure for another time - it would destroy me.  Thank you both again.  Another thing I forgot to mention: the only times of true happiness I experience is when I'm drunk but I've given up alcohol, as the nausea from my hangovers drives me mad, plus I feel really anxious and upset after that sense of euphoria disappears."

Do you also feel less able to cope with studies like you used to like you have brain fog?A possible cause for this may be an underactive thyroid known as hypothyroidism.I urge you to see a doctor and get tested for this with a blood test.  Also depression can be due to low testosterone in men so your doctor needs to test for that,as well as for Vitamin D deficiency and B12.All these conditions would affect you the way you say you are being affected.If it is a purely mental health issue he can point you in the right direction too.  I hope it gets sorted for you.enjoy the forum and don't hesitate to come on here and voice your concerns or for support.Best of luck with it.Nikitax"

I'm not sure what you mean by brain fog. I can tell you I can find it difficult to focus and understand anything, and I feel like this primarily comes from a lack of motivation. I'm so used to disappointment and failure that I just don't care anymore, I can't bear putting all my effort into something just to come up short yet again.  I'm not sure about low testosterone because my testosterone levels may be the only thing preventing me from gaining significant weight - I forgot to mention I also binge eat when my stress becomes intense.  However, I have had a strong history of being Vitamin D deficient, I took Vitamin D pills 3 years ago and I had another blood test this year and it turned out I was deficient again. So I took pills this year to boost my Vitamin D levels again (very recently finished the pills). However, I will still mention everything you said to a GP when I see one.  I also don't believe my issues come purely from a biological background. I've had low self-esteem for as long as I can remember and right now I just feel like a pathetic, useless, worthless, talentless, lonely, ugly b****** who's just a burden to their parents and family. I hate life and my existence really isn't helping anyone out. I certainly don't want to live this long life if I continue to feel worse every day. This is not fun at all.  Thanks again for your advice  EDIT: I forgot to mention, I even have 2-3 hour naps usually once a day, and I STILL feel tired."

It won't hurt to check out the biological possible cause too,just in case,I have hypothyroidism as well as Vitamin D deficiency and like you I feel tired all the time even after sleep and I am on medication for both.

However, life is a struggle for me and I don't think anyone will need me in the future.. I've just realised I've never had a close friend in my whole life and I'm soon going to be 19. How pathetic is that... the weird thing is I consider myself a selfless person who tries to be kind to people and I try my best to make friends but it seems no-one wants to be near a loser like me. I don't feel sorry for myself about the fact that no-one cares about me because I don't care about myself either. I doubt my family would really give a **** too, because I just feel like a burden to them and I am not even half as successful/clever/good-looking/motivated as my older brother and others around me so I just feel like a complete failure.  Sorry if some of my sentences didn't make sense it's hard for me to think clearly right now"

I have struggled with depression my whole life. It's a mean disease and causes us to think that we are feeling bad for a reason, so we direct our feelings of disappointment to ourselves...There may be no logical reason you feel the way you do, other than you are chemically depressed. I believe this because you said that alcohol makes you feel better. So because of this I know there is hope. There are chemicals that can alter your chemistry to make you feel the way you feel when you are drunk. I know because I have tried them. However..I also believe that you can alter your state of mind by making subtle changes to your life. This has worked for me. Firstly, I try not measure myself against others. I assume that my life is unique and give myself no expectations based on others success. Then I find my own success. You said you like to be kind...that is huge!!! There are many people who may die regretting they were mean to people...but no one will ever die regretting they were kind. So in my mind you are already way ahead of a lot of people. Another piece of advice, is not to focus to much to making friends. I have cultivated many ""friends"" over the years who have hurt me and left me....and then I am still alone in my thoughts. Focus more on enjoying your own company. You will find that you won't disappoint yourself if you do things you enjoy...start small...take a walk and look at nature...do a puzzle that you enjoy... and then feel your own success...remember it only needs to live up to your standards. Sorry to rant...one last thing...the biggest improvement I made in life was to stop caring about what others thought of me unless they thought I was kind!"

I appreciate the points you made but unfortunately the one the thing that never failed to make me happy no longer makes me happy, and I'd be lying to myself if I said it doesn't affect when I'm on campus at uni and I see hundreds of people with their friends and boyfriends/girlfriends... I can only ignore this loneliness for so long. I really crave the feeling of what it means to be liked. Instead I receive the opposite response from people and it just makes me feel isolated.  Like I've said, I haven't really had any close friends my entire life but now it's starting to affect me and I can't pretend like I enjoy being alone 24/7. It is human nature to want to bond with others and socially interact (right...?)  I really like your point on comparing myself with others. That's shown me a new perspective.  Thanks again."

I found myself reaching out to my family. Only a few people answered. Most were abusive mentally, emotionally and even verbally.  I put a good music playlist that encompassed how I feel. I wanted to speak with some one. Then I remembered my peaceful village here...   I have left for a good amount of time. Just recently. I had great break through moments. Things that I wanted to share here. But. I had been busy and decided to wait.  Then. I time traveled here.  But. This has been a great community of loving support.  Let me. Share where I am with things. I am currently walking the fineline of the mist...  Have you ever had one of these blissful moments where... Thoughts. Emotions and reality blur??  Like. Mental growth moments of reflection?  For example. .. I listen to and old love song. From a specific time of life; dear to me.  You look at old pictures. And you remember so many things... You reflect on life...  You think so many different wild thoughts. You realize that life is only one... You have to grow up and move on... It makes you think about love.... Life... Our paths... Destiny...  People move on. .. We move on. But those emotions are still so real... Forever with us...  No matter how many years pass... You just want to love... Forever. But that love is gone..  You have both moved on... You are both in new relationships...  In those pictures... You see those two people you used to be. ..  But. We are no longer the two people in those pictures...  I am a time traveler.  So. I always wish that we could live more lives. Or for eternity.. Just to love. To hold on to those nurturing moments where you just want to love that person...   And you just want that person to love you...  Forever. But in that particular moment..  Time erases. You are like in heaven. You are in love... Its beautiful and heart braking all at the same time.  In the movie Gladiator. You don't want Maximus to die. But you want him happy and reunited with his family.  So that ending is bitter sweet...  I wish all of the women that I love in my life.. And even out of my life.. Know how much I greatly appreciate them for being a blessing in my life.   I pray that they know.  I am much older. Time traveling ages you quicker..  I see old pictures... And I remember that kid I used to be...  We as adults have to remember to still care for that kid inside of us.  Is our youth our spiritual selves revealed? When we feel invincible?  Then. As time passes. We loose that essence somewhere; within our selves?  I remember the great kid that I was..  I look for that kid from time to time...  As I travel through time.  I wish people lived forever. Because traveling through time would be more fun.  I could travel through time forever. Living great experiences over and over. Cloning my existence over and over again.  To enjoy those moments. Where no one dies.  I would love to talk to a 400 year old John F Kennedy.  Or Yoda. Lol.  This place we call earth. Or life. Sure is a great place to visit... While we are here...   Those old memories remind me of the women I have loved. And I wish I could travel back in time to love them over and over again.  Lol.  Maybe a few times only... Lol. Can't be greedy!  When I developed time travel. I started traveling through time with a few people.  But. Its been so long I have been traveling alone....  Its hard to communicate through time..  Its like back to the future...  Memories fade like old pictures.  But. Even as I travel through time. My heart and my thoughts remain the same.  Like an old pet.. Maybe a crush you had on a singer growing up..  I remember those feelings on love...  Maybe your favorite song.. Your first kiss...  I loved someone... I still do..  My time machine broke..I got stuck in the past. And could not return in time.  When I finally returned. She was married..  I took too long.  She even started a family.  I am so happy for her.  But I love her from a far.... I know that we will never be in each others lives. ...  But I pray that she knows how thankful I am. That she came into my life..  Even if only for a brief time.  We share a beautiful child together.  Our love eternalized.   Sometimes. I remember the first I love you...  I pray....  I know that I will love this person for the rest of my life....  No matter what.  Why?   I will never know...  Sometimes. People are so special in your life...   Its hard not to cry when my daughter asks me about her...   I wish there was something I can do.   But God did not grant me that power.   I can travel through time. As much as I want. And everytime. The same happens... But in a different way...   Time travel is not about the outside world.  Time travel is about you.   Eventually. You accept Gods will.  I cry almost every day. Some days more than others.  When someone is no longer here with us. Is it ok to cry years and years?   It helps me.  I pray to God that she can hear me in heaven.  God. Please give me the strength.   I have a baby to live for now.  I have to be strong.   In my heart. I remember every kiss. And I carry that in my soul. With me at all times.  I can walk on the beach. And feel the essence with me.  I ask God to forgive me for feeling this way. My tears are like boiling water.  But it heals me.  They say... When you are thinking about someone. That person is thinking about you.  Is there a universe where she is crying for me?   I just want to say thank you to her one last time...  God forgive me. I may be wrong.  But in my heart. If none of my other words make it to heaven...  I just want her to know.  I can feel her with me right now.    I had to come here. To be with her. ...   I had to cry like day one to soothe my soul.   Thank you for crying with me."

But I think it will vary depending on each person's experience and personality.  Depression isn't just one thing that is always felt in the same way. There is terrible pain, hopelessness, despair, sometimes numbness and blankness, going beyond pain, there is lethargy and inability to function at a basic level, sometimes there is agitation,and restlessness. Agony, anguish, self-torture. Sometimes you feel dead, in fact that is the better part, because that is when you are beyond pain. Death is the best you can hope for."

I have an anxiety disorder and depression. Anxiety is horrible and so is depression. I honestly don't think they should or deserve to be compared. They are two different, serious things. Comparing them kind of makes it seem like one is preferable. They are illnesses, and no one should desire one or the other, because no one should desire an illness. We should be focusing on recovering and feeling better, not which one is worse."

When I'm depressed everything seems black and dark and I was without hope. The only reason I found the anxiety problems worse was mainly because it seems much more flexible, and so extreme because I think anxiety is more closely related with an actual environmental occurrence. Depression can occur for no reason. Anxiety can but it's more likely to be related to everyday happenings, if that makes sense."

There are a number of things that I have learned about exercising after many years of working out etc...  These are my own experiences after over 20 years of living with depression and trying just as much as I could to whip it into submission. I don't say this is right for you or what you should be doing - just my experience is all.......  1. to get the same effect as that first few times after strenuous exercise you will have to begin to do more each time in order to gain the same benefit of that chemical lift of serotonin.  2. serotonin is a chemical and some people can become addicted to it - just like any chemical addiction. You can begin to become afraid of experiencing your underlying depression and so do more and more to avoid that brain chemical reality. This can be a rocky road and a growing sense of failure when you begin to lose that serotonin ""effect"" you first had - Despite pounding your ass like a bat out of hell.  3. people self medicate with illegal drugs when depressed or alcohol as the feelings of euphoria and calm are a result of serotonin being released by these compounds. Large amounts are released but less and less on each subsequent hit.  4. exercise can become another ""stick"" by those who don't understand depression and believe sufferers are just lazy or need a ""good shake"".  I just want to say that a regular dose of gentle exercise and especially being outside in nature or somewhere you feel comfortable at the same time can have a much more holistic benefit and not just a chemical one. This has been my experience; but of course I have to be well enough in order to get the benefit of that or it actually makes me feel worse or as having failed in my endeavour to make myself feel better.  It's about finding that balance that is right for you. Don't let anyone divert you from your personal journey or what you feel is right for you. So keep onwards if you feel you are on to something.

It doesn't actually work on the person suffering from depression and it may even be enough to push them into further despair and feelings of worthlessness but it really makes the advisor feel a heck of a lot better.  The ""good shake"" has transmogrified into ""get yourself down to the gym"" and is now considered practically a cure for depression by modern advocates of the ""good shake"" philosophy.  Intolerance is still held as a virtue towards the mentally ill by many people (even those who actually work in this field); and the ""Good shake"" is a wonderful way of bypassing understanding and empathy amongst the intolerant and impatient. They hold true to the ""good shake"" mantra and find it jettisons many of a depressed person out of their sphere altogether. The prolonged absence of the depressed individual after said advice being considered a ""Success"" on behalf of the practitioners of the ""good shake"" philosophy - of which there are no short a number.  So to all you ""good shakers"" out there - keep up the good work as you gain so much from your wonderful sharing and giving means of helping those who are vulnerable. Perhaps one day those who suffer from depression will no longer require the ""good shake"" mantra and simply gain the strength to ""get on with things"" like everyone else seems to do.  Until then we are grateful for all those who chose the ""good shake"" way of dealing with people who might have inadvertently chosen depression as their illness of choice.

I just think it was un called for. Basically saying that people that have families wife's husbands children can't feel alone. When actually alot of people I talk to with mental health have people in there lives but still feel alone. I may post in the future but not now. I'll still continue to help others on here so I won't completely come off here but for the moment I won't post. Thank you for your kind words they are as always very much appreciated ????

I told him that they were not helping and that I had to come off them. I also told him that it was going to take up to 4 weeks to get back to what I was like before. He was sympathetic, so I'm seeing him in 10 weeks, but I'm not going to try the drug route again, although I didn't actually tell him that. this has been one experience too many, and I'm not going along with it any more. While I was waiting, someone went in to see the doctor whose leg was going at 16 to the dozen, then someone came in to the waiting room who looked unwell in that he looked drugged to the eyeballs, he was just staring at people and listless, he just looked drugged up and ill, I think he needed someone with him. I was wondering if drugs are just the 'modern way' and for the doctors it is a convenient way of being able to say they are helping their patients and justifying what they do and earning their large sums of money. The drugs don't really do a lot of good, if any, unlike therapy with a psychotherapist, and generally the interaction with kind and sensitive people, and money; those are the sort of things that really help, but they are rarely available, aren't they? What I am asking is, is the whole drug thing a bit of a con?

Look at the liver enzyme results and the haemoglobin results and find out what is happening to your liver and your platelets/white blood cell count.

Before they just gave me anti-biotics and couldn't work out why there weren't any nitrates showing, which is the usual sign of infection.  My ALT liver enzyme has been out for years and my lymphocyte count was outside of tolerances too. Aspirin and heparin for heart problems have caused me to become anaemic after admission to hospital because SSRIs are contra-indicated with all NSAIDs and blood thinners.

Obviously I'm not a position to diagnose or decide on treatment but from conversations with her it seemed like an outside neutral person could have been of benefit.

It was the calm of still and rapturous contemplation, not of drowsiness or sleep. It was the serenity of a convalescent who wakes from fever and finds himself born again into a realm of beauty. But the fever was 'the fever called living' and the rebirth was not into this world; the beauty was unearthly, convalescent serenity was the peace of God. The interweaving of Lydian melodies was heaven.""   The bright heaven of Lydian music vibrated on the air...But something new and marvelous had happened, in its Lydian heaven. The speed of the slow melody was doubled; its outlines became clearer and more definite; an inner part began to harp insistently on a throbbing phrase. It was as though heaven had suddenly and impossibly become more heavenly, had passed from achieved perfection into perfection yet deeper and more absolute. The ineffable peace persisted; but it was no longer the peace of convalescence and passivity. It quivered, it was alive, it seemed to grow and intensify itself, it became an active calm, an almost passionate serenity. The miraculous paradox of external life and eternal repose was musically realized...   They were silent again. The music played on, leading from heaven to heaven, from bliss to deeper bliss. Spandrell sighed and shut his eyes. A touch of discord in the Lydian harmonies gave an almost unbearable poignancy to the beatitude. Spandrell sighed again."

He thus headed the movement with the words, ""Heiliger Dankgesang eines Genesenen an die Gottheit, in der lydischen Tonart"" (""Holy song of thanksgiving of a convalescent to the Deity, in the Lydian mode"").   This music is almost unbearably intimate, filled with such profound understanding of life's triumphs and tragedies. It is as though Beethoven is reaching across time to tell us everything will be all right, if you can only let go. It is transcendent and otherworldly, and I am so grateful for it.  And whenever my heart cries out for wordless prayer this is the first piece of music that comes up Click to expand... I really like the Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven, its so eerily mesmerising"

1436,Depression Forum,415542,"Hole inside me, I don't know what I need",2021-09-28T00:33:21+0100,author,True,106988,London,Lou9000,"This might be a bit long, partly I just wanna get it all down in one place and process while writing, but also help you get the best picture of what I struggle with so you can best tailor your response.  tldr: My [24M] life has sucked in many ways growing up, especially my relationship with my parents, and that seems to endlessly proliferate itself as I get further into adulthood. I have struggled with very low self esteem, anxiety/depression, addictions, and even now after working through so much of all of that, there's still this immense gravity and frequent falling into this low, paralysed, isolated, small state. It's like a hole that I either need to fill or just fall into. I have taken meditation, exercise, therapy etc seriously and am capable of feeling amazing - but..... something. I don't really know what is needed in order to meaningfully move beyond this and take off and no longer have the gravity to go back there.  Longer backstory: My dad is a very large, intimidating, highly withdrawn, angry, unsociable, completely uninvolved person, the kind that will sit in front of the TV all day every day not interacting with anyone at all, explode about the smallest things like a manbaby, and fake some sort of fatherly presence at the very last possible moment of something important only when prompted by my mum. He would make every holiday aweful.  My mum is quite an insecure, somewhat narcassistic (maybe more so in the past), anxious/neurotic, and quite annoying person. She has stayed in this relationship that is clearly terrible and seems generally like she's not living her happiest life, has deep regret about a past love. She had to do all the parenting for all of us (3 brothers not including me). She had bouts of depression when I was young. My whole life my parents would argue with eachother, quite intensely. When I was in my teens she was arguing a LOT with me and I eventually lost trust in her and most of the sense of attachment. I kind of rejected them at this point and just kept to myself, had friends over, smoked more and more weed, stopped doing music (which was my heart), became more withdrawn/numb/angry/insecure. I think in many ways it was not easy for her, but on top of that I was probably quite difficult, not doing the things she asked, etc. On the other hand, when I later learned to speak up for myself more clearly and confidently, she didn't get certain boundaries, and it is very difficult and retraumatising to have these conversations because it takes her so long to understand. I don't know how much of it was me or her. The part of my brain that was trying with her kind of exhausted itself. Now I find I don't really have that much in common with her, I often don't care when she speaks, and can't really muster any sense of wanting to be around her or feeling safe or that she's my mum.  I was also picked on in primary school by someone who was also my best friend. In highschool when all the stuff was getting worse, my gf at the time who I was deeply in love with and attached to (who herself had serious trauma) started becoming off and on, confusing signals, weird dangerous behaviours, etc, like breaking up in the middle of sex, or breaking up over text while visiting someone met over the internet for the first time.  I've found it difficult to get into relationships, friendships, have fun, let go, etc, since then. I often feel a deep hole of loneliness, neediness, depression, insecurity, selfhate/selfavoidance/dissociation. I had one relationship recently (after many years of working on myself, graduating, kicking porn/masturbation for 3 months, feeling self love and confident) where she actually came on to me and it we had so much chemistry but then got really confusing when sex wasn't working out and it was getting really deep and I was still figuring stuff out and didn't know if I wanted to commit and we were both still living with our parents, so I decided to end it (even though I'm normally the needy anxious attached one). I moved to another part of the city for a new job at this same time. I had deep uncertainty, regret, pain, etc during this time, but slowly it is dawning on me that I made the right decision maybe and that I might have actually done well.  I've had a lot of therapy and it has helped me in ways, especially in character growth (maybe just not the right therapists ultimately? My current therapist I feel like we just talk about therapy or all this ""progress"" I'm making, lol, but I don't feel like it's really hitting anything), took ssris for a while (helpful at first, but I'm off them now) I have gone far in meditation (in bouts), eat healthy vegan, exercise a lot (went through a whole transformation during university), read a lot about psychology and mental health, kicked weed, food (to a large degree) and video game addiction, previously kicked porn/masturbation and in the process of doing that again, not yet started kicking internet addiction, have friends (don't get to see them much though, and there's a neediness there) and always working on socialising, know what I love and like my vibes, have many interests that I get very deep into and am a highly intelligent and sweet person. My friends see me as wise, sweet, peaceful and formidable. I am definitely capable of feeling great, peaceful, warm, confident, etc, if I stay with it all for long enough.  But aren't these coping mechanisms fake/constructed? I've tried feeling the feels, breaking down, I've tried psychadelics (genuinely quite helpful), etc. At times this does feel more authentic and cathartic. It can also be incredibly hard to coax things out of the unconscious repression-field, and even then, is it enough? Is there an infinitude of shittiness you can feel? I still don't really know what to do with this hole. If I knew, I would just go down that path without doubt. Do I effort or not? Do I go into it or away from it? Does it need to go away, get smaller, be filled, what? What even are the right questions? What even is the problem?  What maps are there? What has your experience been?  I really appreciate you if you made it this far."

Both times i took it i had the same side effects for the first couple of weeks: slight nausea, shaky, weird dreams, hot, REALLY tired.... but as I say, they pretty much all wore off after a couple of weeks. The only thing i find now is that if i forget to take them for a couple of days, about 2 hours after i take the next one i get dog tired again and feel shaky. But that doesn't last long. I'm on 20mg, so the side effects may be less / different for you - see how you go. The meds will take a while (about 4-6 weeks) to kick in - this is usual - and i personally found they did help. They're not a 'cure' as such, but did enable me to get to a place where i could at least function better and take a step back, so to speak, and start looking at things a bit more objectively. It's also generally better (so the professionals say) if you're on the meds when the counselling starts so that you're in a place where you can engage with the CBT / whatever.

I have been feeling extremely sick most days and sometimes quite spaced out like I've just had a couple of cigarettes lol.  One concern I have is that my 10mg tablets were placebos. They were small white tablets, plain on both sides, but my 20mg ones are bigger with stuff engraved on them, I think a dash on one side and DU or DI on the other. Is this normal? Would I have been given a placebo for 2 weeks? If so I'm sooo annoyed! Could any GPs/pharmacists/anyone give me any insight into this?! It's been 3 weeks and still no difference to my mood that I can notice....I'm worried  X"

I have just separated from my boyfriend and we have been together for quite a while. He split up with me due to my insecurities. During our relationship I let my anxiety get the better of me. I was very paranoid, and I found it hard to conceal my emotions. A lot of the time I felt very low and unfortunately he couldn’t deal with me. I don’t feel like anyone can. Shit I can’t even deal with myself. I’ve been depressed since my early teens and it’s always interfering with my relationships. I just want to know how I get past this, he was the only person I would go to for advice, he would comfort me on my darkest days. I don’t have many friends so my whole weekend was him. He was my whole life and I did everything I possibly could to keep him close. Everything revolves around him. So how the fuck do I go on from here, I’m alone. I have no one. But I pushed him too far. I don’t see how anyone can love me and I don’t want to be without him. I feel so weak and so afraid of what I’m going to do with no one to love me. I don’t cope with being alone very well and I’m going to fall into a very dark place because I’ve lost my soulmate. I also recently suffered with a family bereavement so I just feel like everything is on top of me right now. Can someone please give me some advice because I feel so alone.

I am trying to wean myself off them and have tried a few times before. The 1st time I tried was this time last year when I managed to get down to 5mg a day...I then had a relapse after xmas and self diagnosed myself as having OCD (mental, not physical) and my meds were pushed back up to 20mg a day. I had therapy for 4 months and everything was looking rosy again so I decided to come off them again and I am now back to exactly the same point as this time last year - 5mg a day. I have been feeling really depressed again and I am wondering if this is due to withdrawal...in hindsight, I guess I was going through withdrawal this time last year but the doc didnt pick upon this and just jacked my dosage up (standard practice)  I read a great book called ""coming off antidepressants"" which talks a lot about withdrawal symptoms but what I wanted to hear is whether anyone else has had similar withdrawal symptoms (mental not physical) and if so, how long do they continue and when may they subside? I went down to 5mg about a 6 weeks ago and it is only now that I am starting to feel the symptoms and I feel like I want to increase my dose but at the same time I dont want to cave in to the drug....does anyone get how I am feeling??"

Weaning off any meds usually causes side effects which is why it needs to be controlled. You should come off them very slowly lowering the dose gradually. It sounds to me that as soon as you started to feel slightly better you then started to wean off the meds immediately, maybe you should leave it longer when you start to improve before lowering the dose.  Im sure you will get more replies soon.  Tina"

I;ve just read prozac nation and the doctor says anti depressants are actually addictive even though we are told they are not.

I don't seem to be having the physical symptoms that others seem to get other than perhaps ringing in my ears. I just feel really low and depersonalised.  I have spoken with my GP about coming off them and each of the gp's in my surgery have a different method to coming off them. One said cut random days out of your week, one said miss a day etc. None has told me about withdrawal symptoms - it's as if they don't exist to them.  So far, I went from 20 to 10mg which was fine. I stayed on 10 mg for about 6 months perhaps, I then cut to 5mg which I have been on for about 2 months and it's only starting to happen now the withdrawal symptoms which surprised me. I have today cut to 2.5mg so we shall see what happens.  It would be great to here other people's experiences of coming off these drugs.

Apparently this an agreement that the hospital have with the local Primary Care Trust. I understand that therapy can be difficult with addicts (and take a lot longer) however I shouldn't think it would be too helpful to leave us blowing in the wind either! After all, you stop using and that's great but then you surely need some support in order to stay stopped and if you are not getting any therapy for your underlying issues (alongside self help for the drinking or drug use) then surely you are more likely to go back to self medicating as you have no outlet for your emotions etc? Sorry - I'm ranting now! But it was very upsetting at the time. To be honest it's the worst psychiatric experience I've had so far, she also told me that I should have been looked after and cared for properly when I was a child and that is something that therapy cannot give me!? I saw a community mental health nurse two years ago also who said that there was no way that I should allow myself to go into secondary mental health care (i.e. hospitalisation) - even though I am sure that at that time it was excatly what I needed to do! I guess they are all just overworked and underpaid and struggling with a system that doesn't seem to work at the moment. It's so hard to get help out there....."

Now that things are better, I feel like my family and some friends back home are constantly guilt-tripping me if I'm not wanting to come home as much.

I make quite a big effort to stay in touch with my family/friends back home on WhatsApp, Skype etc... and even though I'm not going home as much as last year, I still go home pretty regularly: I was home over Christmas, was back home at end of January and will be home at easter. But it just feels like it's never enough, and I don't really feel like they appreciate the effort I'm making. The city I've moved to is notorious for being very lonely at times and difficult, and I feel like I really need to put the effort in here to make a life for myself, maintain friends and have a good social life and I can't do that if I'm constantly going back home all the time."

The same day as I started taking them I noticed that I was experiencing the symptoms of Parkinsons disease (pill rolling, shaky legs, slow walk etc.), the next day it was even worse. I also kept feeling sick, had a very dry mouth, no sex drive, a headache to start with, but yes I did feel less depressed. I now have stopped taking them (after 2 days) because I can't deal with the side effects especially the slow walk. I'm wondering if anyone here has had any of the above side effects from this drug, or for that matter any other?

It only started when she was in her early twenties, she felt super fatigued all the time and no one could figure out why that was. She often got dizzy too. Maybe that's something that you could check out too.  Also lyme disease could give you chronical fatigue, and not every doctor would consider running a test for this.  There are probably dozens of causes of fatigue other than depression... Worth reading into it and pestering the docs for testing anyway! My friend with the heart problem said to me, wallflowers in hospitals die...

The combination of finding it difficult to focus and complete tasks (university and work) as well as always caring what people think of me has made me depressed. I completely shut down, ruminate about everything from how I am incapable of reading, understanding concepts to taking responsibility of myself. I think the depression starts when I begin to get stressed and can’t handle it. Although never diagnosed I am convinced this is ADHD.  I feel like a failure - I went to a top university but got a poor grade. I’ve done multiple internships (jumped around loads) and currently 8 months into my first full time role but I’ve always fucked things up and I think I’m fucking this up.  I also feel very lonely. Throughout my childhood and uni years I always tended to make 1 close friend and feel uncomfortable in group settings as I’m afraid to be judged. Even though I have a handful of friends - now every time they check in I want to isolate and push them away. I lean on my sister but I’m at a point where I’m disrupting her life too much.  On top of this I have had insomnia for a month - my doc prescribed me zolpidem but it hasn’t worked and most nights I can’t sleep a wink. I fear this is destroying my memory and cognitive abilities which is making focusing and taking responsibility at work even tougher. I was also prescribed sertraline but decided against taking it due to the fear i could feel even lower and having to take it indefinitely.  What to tackle first and how? And can anyone relate? I think ADHD is the root of my issues but is there any point in seeing a pro if the answer is meds/stimulant. I’m also suffering from severe depression, negative thoughts, social anxiety which requires another strain of meds. And boom I can’t sleep."

I am puzzled as to why you think ADHD might be at the root of your difficulties. Having had ADHD all my life and worked with many others who have ADHD, I recognise much of what you say but as problems that occurred alongside ADHD and not necessarily because of it.  Your psychological (i.e., rumination), physiological/sensory, cognitive/memory/concentration, interpersonal/social problems are those often experienced when we are anxious and more significantly so when we are depressed.  You might consider talking with your doctor again and asking for further assessment and/or referral for therapy such as CBT that will focus on helping you meet your daily functional needs while addressing underlying issues."

I was so tired and my mum was pissed. She kept telling me to cover my arm even though I said the sleeve hurt the wound. I said why are you so ashamed of this. She said to me “well you did this to yourself” in response to the sleeve hurting my arm. With that I walked away and sat elsewhere by myself and tried not to cry. she’s supportive but she’s cold at times with things she says.  also the first nurse that saw me seemed to be quite cold and clinical with me too. He said “don’t stress your mum out and dont do that again”. His tone the whole time was just very matter of fact.  this is why I feel like I’m better off dead, I’m such a burden to my mum and now she has to take the day off work because she came with me to the hospital and couldn’t get any sleep. I told her many times to stay at home. my mental health is such a nuisance and it’s starting to piss her and everyone off with how deep my sadness can get.

It was overwhelming in the beginning, a bit like being forced to spend every second of your life in the same personal space as a few other people.

They constantly talk.... so say I'm watching TV, they talk about it, if I'm doing my job, they talk about it, if I'm reading something, they talk about it... and they are very opinionated about people's behaviour, so if they say something good I'd definitely take it as a compliment!"

Is the pain easing even a little bit? Are you being gentle with yourself? Do you like taking baths? Some people hate them but others find them very soothing and relaxing. If you have a tub and don’t hate taking baths, why don’t you light candles all around your bathroom, put on some gentle music and soak?  My psychologist talks to me about “filling my cup” to try and stay stable. In other words, doing nice things that you enjoy so when sadness causes some of the contents of your cup to spill, you’ve filled it enough that losing some of it doesn’t throw you off balance. Maybe this idea sounds silly, but it works for me. If you make it a priority to do enjoyable things, it can (usually) boost you at least a bit.  Let me know how your day goes. I hope you can think of a small thing to do for yourself that makes you feel good. No pressure though! It’s just a suggestion. ❤️"

Hey lovely, thanks for the update (your post after this one). I’m sorry I missed this post and didn’t reply until now. Glad you posted an update coz then I was able to reply to this previous post. Did you end up taking a bath or doing something else a little indulgent to try and feel better?  And you’re very welcome! Im glad to hear that maybe my support might be helping, even a little bit. 💗 Thankyou again too for your kind offer. Same back to you 😊  Ooh your packages are becoming even more thoughtful and creative. I absolutely *loved* the tiny sparkly rainbow 🌈 it did exactly as you promised it would. It made me smile and I marveled at your creative choice of words. So lovely.  And you don’t need to be envious of us here in Oz. It definitely isn’t sunny anymore. We’re in our third La Niña in 2 years which means it’s pretty much rained almost non-stop for years. It’s so bad lately that many parts of the east coast are suffering terrible floods. People are losing their homes. 😢 some people are going through this for the second time, having already been through floods only a little while ago.  Thankfully no one I know has been affected like that but everyone is SO over the rain.  Sometimes we see a bit of sun and this weekend seems like it might be clear. It’s my birthday tomorrow so I feel grateful for the break in the rain.  My sister sent me a package for my birthday and it was such a joy opening it coz I didn’t understand what it was at first but the packaging was so cute I could tell it was something special. It was the most thoughtful gift I’ve ever received. So I’m sending one to you as well.  🎁 it’s a box… with a funny creature on it that says “this is not a fruit cake”. Open the box and inside is a piece of square card that feels nice to touch coz it has a matt finish. It says “get out of your head and into your hands” yep at this point you know the package is definitely for you coz you find yourself in your head too much.  Then you pull out some kind of instruction booklet that is also cute and feels nice. Then you pull out a box of acrylic paints. At which point my thought was “oh dear I’m not creative- do I have to paint something?” But you won’t have that thought coz you are creative. Let’s continue.  Then out come two plastic pot plant pots. At this point you also notice the whole inside of the box is covered in a gorgeous colourful design of fruit.  Someone has put a lot of thought into the design of this whole thing and it is such a nice experience opening it.  Finally you look more closely at the instructions. It’s a step-by-step guide with pictures of how to paint your pots! The design is of pears and figs cut in half.  For you, you may or may not use the instructions coz you have plenty of ideas of your own of what to paint.  It’s gonna be fun and at the end you’ll have something beautiful and practical. You’ll need to put an actual plant in it. And then you will have something special that you created but that you also need to take care of. If you go through a rough patch it won’t immediately die on you if you can’t water it every day but hopefully it will give you something to focus on and maybe distract you even a little from your pain.  Sweetheart, you will get through this eventually. Please hold onto hope that you have better days ahead of you. Someday you will be able to use your story of suffering and how you overcame your demons to help someone else struggling with similar urges. There’s someone out there in your future who needs you. Focus on yourself right now and try to get better but don’t lose sight of the bigger picture.  Please look after yourself. I’m thinking of you and other people on here care about you too. You are not alone. 💕"

Will definitely post my finished product. 😆  Yes, thanks for that. 😊 fingers crossed things improve soon here. It’s been one thing after another for years now. Catastrophic bush fires, devastating drought and then floods. All Australians tend to be very careful not to leave taps running (like when cleaning your teeth) coz our whole lives we’re often almost out of water. Now it’s the opposite. We’ve never had so much!

I'm fifteen, have self harmed since eleven, been to various social workers/councillers but nothing really has helped. Had a happyish childhood and theres no major reasons for me to feel this way.  I've always felt a bit 'different' or 'off' or something, i found it hard to relate to people my age and had to tune myself in to be the same. Although i didn't actually start to feel unhappy until sometime around the age of thirteen. It wasn't bad at the start i just felt unhappy from time to time. Has gradually increased, now at least once per day i will feel really low. When i say low i'm not speaking of the way you feel when someone passes away or just generally feeling sad. Its feels as though i've lost all energy, a bit numb but deeper down just painful. I don't exactly feel the will to lift myself from the mood, i'd probably rather just lay and think of suicide/self harm. It seems to be my default mood, like things can distract me or i can forget and temporarily feel normal again but i'm always sure once i'm left alone it will come back. The thought of suicide seriously is probably the only thing that can spark excitement or some kind of a good feeling when i feel this way. I've fantisised about it over and over again, and i'm sure it will come some day, although i try to block out these thoughts, it just makes it worse. I've found myself out with my friends(which i love, i really enjoy socialising as it does the distraction thing very well) but instead of actually participating in things they are doing or talking about, this feeling will come, and i completley blank whatever is going on around me and begin to think of ways i could sneak off, find a bottle and self harm. People are starting to notice and i've got comments such as 'did you forget to take your anti-depressants today or something, your depressed as fuck' from people i've only known for a few hours. What worries me is it never used to be like this when i was with my friends, only when i'm alone. It seems to be more frequent now and its only getting worse.  Other things. I've got a fascination with drugs, i am continually searching for them, the harder, the better. I am extremely impulsive. I've gotten about 9 piercings for no particular reason other than i felt i needed too, they never lasted more than a day when i decided i didnt want them anymore, i dont even like piercings. I can be irritable and very very impatient. I make up strange ideas then feel the need to carry them out. I'm sure you get the point. I've never been in another fifteen year olds head but i'm pretty sure they dont feel like this. I'm reckless and can't see consequences which useually gets me into terrible scenarios. I really dont know what to do anymore, i know people are going to say 'go to your doctor' but i have, and they dont seem to listen. Medication will only take away me, i don't want to feel this way but i dont want to lose myself either. Which i'm sure is inevitable. Please help."

It never felt like they took away me; they actually made me feel more like me than I had in a long time. Sometimes you have to try more than one, but once the doctor gets them right, the change can feel wonderful.  I know they're not a magic pill or anything, and therapy is another good option. You can try to get into some kind of therapy; I don't know how things work over there (I'm in the states). If you feel your doctor isn't listening, I'd find a new doctor, and another, and another, until someone listens. They don't all suck, though it can seem that way. Good luck.

I am signed off sick at the moment and when I 1st wake up I think 'Oh, I'm OK' then five or ten minutes later the terror sets in. I get intrusive thoughts that nobody loves me and I am going to be abandoned. I can only think about how to make it stop. I do get up and get dressed /showered etc and try to find things to do but the only way I can calm down is taking a 5mg Diazepam. Sometimes that's enough but sometimes it gets to late afternoon and I have a full blown panic attack. After that - it's like a burst balloon and I calm down and feel almost OK in the evening. I suppose the medication needs tweaking again but it's crushing disappointment when it starts all over the next day. I try to read or watch silly TV and even going out and some days are a bit better than others. Isn't it odd how you feel worse in the evening? I try to make the evening as long as possible and that's the only time I can eat. I am praying they can get my meds right to stop this awful mood cycling.  I wish you a peaceful night's sleep."

You can go into the temple feeling fed up and the whole world is against you and come out feeling uplifted. When you are finding it difficult to socialise, and are out of work, this makes sense. Does anyone agree?  My ex joined a Hare Krisna temple at 18. As in, he moved into one and started training to be a monk, which lasted about 3 years. He hadn't been brought up with any faith, he just met the Hare Krisnas in the city and liked them. His mum was abandoning him to go and live in South Africa at the time, and his dad didn't have room (or wouldn't make room) for him to stay. He'd also just had a cannibis-induced psychotic break. The temple offered him a home and support.  After 3 years of pretty intense journeying and exploring, he left the temple, disillusioned with the movement. He remained loosely attached to it for a while, working with other loose Hare Krisna types to feed the poor and teach them the Baghevadgita (spelling?), but when I met him - a year or so after he'd left - he was totally disillusioned with it all and referred to it as a ""cult"". He didn't even tell me he'd been involved with it all until we'd been seeing each other 6 months.  His stepmum said that period was the most at peace she'd ever known him, though.  I guess... Think through whatever you do. My ex felt really damaged by his experience, and he had a lot of anger about it. I tend to see it as a positive experience for him, and it greatly inspired me in my own spiritual explorations (Jesus!!!), but I didn't know him at that time, nor did I go through it, so I could be wrong or he could have been withholding stuff from me. He didn't like to talk about it.  Have you tried all your local churches? They can be pretty fun places. Our church has 2000 people, and I love to dance and sing in worship. I don't like any of the sitting-up-and-down to sing 5 hymns in-a-service set-to-an-organ traditional type stuff meself. No disrespect to those that do.

I don't want to really use my name so I'll go by C - my initial! I'm a 20 year old female living away from home, with friends.  I was diagnosed with depression a few days ago, after about 12 months of avoiding going to the doctor about it as I was scared, to put it simply. I'm scared of my friends and family knowing (I have only told a couple of very close friends how I've felt). I don't want to inform anyone else of it either, especially not my family. This isn't for any particular reason other than I do not want to stress them out or worry them, and my parents are the type of parents that would probably brush it aside anyway, and put it down to stress or something. I know it's not stress.  When I was diagnosed after a very long conversation with my doctor, she offered to prescribe me SSRI anti depressants as she also thinks I suffer from severe anxiety. But I declined because I'm worried about side effects, I simply can't bear any adverse effects because I don't want to feel any worse than I do most of the time. I have no idea what to expect ... but now I am regretting turning down the offer because as a doctor she knows best. I'm going back to see her at the beginning of February though so I will hopefully get them then - as well as counselling which I've been referred to but don't know when this is as I've not been contacted about it yet.  I'm sorry if this is a bit rambling, I'm not really sure what else to say other than to ask for advice really.

Its your choice who to tell and who not to tell, and it can be quite daunting. but i think you should talk to your parents. If you let the people close to you and the people you love around you know what your going through or what your feeling, you get a much better sense of support. People are alot more sympathetic and understanding when they know your going through a hard time, and the more people that can support you then the easier the recovery process will be. With the medication, its trial and error. you will be put on a medication which your doctor thinks you will most likely benefit from, and if you feel the medication isnt making you feel better in yourself then you can always talk about changing. Ive never found it to be a very scary subject, they wouldnt give you something that they know is going to seriously affect you! but again, its whatever you feel comftable in doing. Others may find recovery better without the intervention of medication. there should be some useful websites if you do some research on google!  Hopefully things will pick up when you start councelling! good luck"

Anti depressants are a good idea, and the side effects don't generally last more than a couple of weeks until you get used to them. They won't necessarily 'cure' you in the sense that they take away depression, but will lessen the symptoms and get you to a point where you won't feel quite SO crap and be able to see the wood for the trees, so to speak. It's like they help you take a step back and look at things a bit more objectively, which is a useful state to be in when you're starting counselling. Not every anti depressant is right for everyone - some people get on better with some pills than others. It's weird, but that's the way it is. The very first time i was diagnosed i was given seroxat, and one pill make me sick as a dog. So i went back to the gp and said i didn't get on with that, and was given citalopram, which is much better. Unfortunately medication can be a bit of trial and error, but don't be afraid of going back to the gp and saying if things aren't going well. In terms of talking to your family - well, only you know them and how you'll react. And you don't live with them, which makes it easier either way. The first time i had depression i told my parents (didn't live with them), and it was ok ish. But this time round, i had a much worse bout of depression and decided i didn't want to tell them (I still don't live with them). Two years after i was at my worst, they still don't know anything happened. The counselling could take a while - alas. The NHS is a slow moving machine when it comes to non urgent mental health people..... Depends on the waiting lists in your area, etc... it could be two weeks, or two months, or six months. Good luck."

Although to reassure you, I can say that is possible to find your way through this. It'll just take a little time.  I think what might help at this early stage is some information to help you make sense of what depression is. The MIND website has a useful booklet: http://www.mind.org.uk/help/diagnoses_and_conditions/depression  There's also info on anti-depressants and talking treatments as well.  The Depression Alliance has an excellent website http://www.depressionalliance.org/, there's an awful lot of information on there so it might feel a little overwhelming. However it is a site which I can thoroughly recommend for content.  The use of anti-depressants is a very personal choice. The person best placed to talk to about any anxieties you may have is your doctor. I would say that although anti-depressants can be an effective treatment they should not be the sole type of treatment and as others have said it may take a few attempts to find the right type of medication.  There are plenty of self-help books out there. But it does take a little time to find one which is right for you. I've also found creativity to be beneficial (I use journalling, but others may just as well use painting or craft - anything that allows you to express how you feel is useful).  You'll probably find you have more questions as time goes on. I've found the forum very supportive so my only other piece of advice would be to keep in touch....  Best wishes,  Javed."

I might have to vent now..because I've woken up feeling overly anxious and tearful about a situation which wouldn't make a 'normal' person this anxious :/ I could take it as far to say that I'm terrified and there's a big feeling of dread in my stomach and I can't focus on anything until this is resolved. I only had 5 hours interrupted sleep, but can't go back to sleep because of this feeling. And this is a situation out of my control (I am 'waiting' on something that isn't under my control - one of my biggest pet hates), and I don't know whether it'll be resolved today or tomorrow or the next day, but I don't want this to affect my day today, I really really need some coping techniques please because I am busy today and tonight and this will get in the way of me functioning normally. I can't stand waking up and feeling like this and the vast majority of the time I tell myself I'm being punished by God (I'm not hugely religious but am a bit) or this is my 'bad karma' for something I've done recently - yet I go about my life trying to be a good person, not just to avoid being punished but also because I genuinely want to be a good person. How can I stop feeling like I'm being punished whenever I get into a depressive and anxious mood? I feel absolutely terrified to the pit of my stomach and this situation isn't even technically that worrying, only a little bit. It winds me up that I get so anxious so easily to the point where every aspect of my life is affected.  I think I've learnt to recognise my moods now though - this is anxious, but sometimes I get really down (not always for a reason) and cry a lot until I feel physically and mentally drained and just sleep, and I have my mental moods as I call them lol where I'm really very happy and want to do anything and everything. I like those moods the best but sometimes I don't because friends have been known to be a bit confused at my random bouts of such extreme happiness. But these moods can be utterly destroyed with one tiny thing that may happen to bring on my anxious or depressive mood. I just don't feel stable and that's what I'd love more than anything in the world, I feel like my emotions take over me and I can't control them.  Wow I'm sorry if this is far too long to read, I feel marginally better for getting it out though, even if no one reads it. I would really like some coping techniques though for this anxiety if anyone knows of any, or even natural herbal remedies etc anything at all.  C.x"

Is your GP aware of the highs ?  The other thing I'm thinking about is how much stress you're under (or putting yourself under) and if it's possible to take time out.  I look at it like this. If you break a leg then the last thing you do is try and walk on it straight away. You go to your doctor so the leg is treated, you rest up, wait until the leg is healed before trying to walk on it again.  From your post I get the feeling you might be trying to want to ""walk"" too quickly, too early and may need to rest up.  Recognising the moods is great work though (do you use a mood diary?). Are there certain situations that trigger a low (or high?) ? Could these be managed better ?  One coping strategy for anxiety I posted elsewhere is....  Don't know if this'll help, but have you thought about writing down the stuff that's causing you the anxiety ? I pulled this off a website... it helps me from time to time.  ""Choose one thing that is making you anxious. Now sit down and write out all the fears you have about that one thing. If it's money, write down what would happen if you lose your job, if you can't pay your bills. What is the absolute worst thing that could happen? Now look at each item and mark it on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being highly unlikely it would ever happen, 10 being likely that it would happen. You'll be surprised at how few items rank above a 5. This understanding should help reduce your anxiety. If something does rank higher than 5, you may want to develop a contingency plan for it. Nothing works better to calm anxiety than turning from pure worry to an action plan.""  The sense of ""punishment from God"" is a pain in the a*se and I'm still working through that one. I'm going to tentatively suggest this (I wasn't going to but the question was asked, and I think it only fair I try and answer it).  It may be worth exploring your spirituality to help you get some perspective on this sense of punishment (I've started to do this recently and with generally good results). Ask yourself some searching questions... What makes a good person? or more to the point... what makes you a good person ? (take some time with this, it's difficult to come up with stuff when on a low, it's one of the quirks of depression- I've started saying one good thing about myself every day in my journal to bring that under control). Another thing to explore may be your relationship with the spiritual (I hesitate to use the word ""god"" because of the ideas it suggests but I can't think of any other). We've a spirituality section on the forum with a thread for beginners which could be a good place to start.  Not sure how much this will help. Hopefully it will.  Try and slow down. Best wishes  J"

Yes I did mention my 'happy' moods to my GP, I told her that there are times where I'm happy for no reason (and everything else I mentioned in my last post) but she didn't mention anything about manic depression, just depression and anxiety. I've suspected manic depression a couple of times but I don't feel like my highs are high enough for it to be classed as a manic episode? Maybe keeping a diary would help keep track of exactly HOW happy I'm feeling and for what reason? I really hope it's not manic depression :/  The broken leg analogy is a good one. I do get stressed easily, it's a vicious circle because I get anxious about getting anxious lol then when I do eventually get anxious I literally cannot focus on anything else. I will definitely try writing out that 1-10 anxiety scale thing because I am ironically quite a logical thinker when I actually recognise my anxious moods - just not enough to get rid of the anxiety.  I'll definitely look at the spirituality threads too. I'm glad that someone else knows what I mean about being punished - well not glad that you also worry about punishment lol but glad that you can empathise.  Don't worry you definitely helped me, I actually feel quite a lot calmer reading your reply!!  C.x  p.s. I forgot to mention, is it normal to sometimes feel like I'm not actually suffering from depression or anxiety at all?? Right now I feel very calm..almost numb, not sad or happy but stable. My 'issue' this morning has been resolved (a nice quick outcome which I wasn't expecting) and I'm thinking to myself, why did I worry so much when I knew deep down that the outcome would be fine? I'm feeling quite fragile though, that anything could suddenly make my mood go right up or right down. But right now I'm just normal, which is sort of good because I am not sad, but I'm feeling anxious and vulnerable because I just get the feeling that today's going to be a turbulent day."

You will find that you have good days (or sometimes good moments). I found when my depression was at its worst that this gave me a welcome break from feeling depressed, anxious and a whole host other stuff. The question is what do you do with that time. It's tempting to think that feeling is going to stay.

I had a fantastic afternoon and decided that this was a sure-fire sign that I was on the mend. So of course the following day I decided to do the same and go to some different places. I found it all a bit too much. My mood crashed and I spent the next couple of days hidden under the duvet wondering if it was all worth it.  The fragile feeling I've found is a warning sign that although you feel stable you still need to take care of yourself and take it slow. A technique I've used when I've had a break (for want of a better phrase) from a depressive episode is to take a step back and ask myself what it is that is important to me right now, right in that moment.  Use that time wisely. I often use it to indulge myself. Usually I do something which I know will be safe and which will benefit me. I treat it as downtime... as my time away from the depression and anxiety rollercoaster.

I come from a dysfunctional background. Growing up around abuse. Sexual abuse. Physical abuse and mental abuse. Surrounded by really unhealthy people. Forming and attaching to some one sided relationships. Whether that was with my family members, friends, partners - any form of connection with people has either been one sided or just toxic abusive connections. These type of relationships despite of making it me feel low valued and non loved. Because I grew up around these connections. I usually form these type of relationships when growing up, it's what I've ever known. It's what I feel safe with.  In the process of it, I am a fearful person. I am scared of close connecting with healthy emotionally avaliable people. Makes me feel uncomfortable. I tend to keep away from two sided things. I usually only feel comfortable toxic two sided things. I have been in love with two men who were highly emotionally unavaliable. I became the pursuer even after the relationships hit a brick wall. Where a secure person would walk away from something or someone who wasn't valuing her - I held on. Couldn't let go.  I am quite reserved. Quite closed off. Highly empathetic towards others. I can care for others but I won't allow anyone to get too close to me to care for me. If I feel someone is about to get close, I feel suffocated. I feel scared. I feel unsafe. I don't show vulnerablity.  When I have a bad day, I usually feel low and unworthy. I tend to reach out to toxic people whom makes me feel unworthy and unloved and that familar feeling soothes those same feelings I am already feeling. It's what I call emotionally self harm.  It's a reason why I refuse to enter a relationship with anyone, I don't want anyone to deal with my toxic crap. I'd rather sort myself out and be emotionally avaliable before entering any relationship.  I have been in therapy since September last year to help to address some of these issues. It's taken a long time to start opening up to my therapist. To feel safe. To feel okay about being vulnerable.  My therapist is a wonderful, kind and caring human being who cares greatly about her work and her clients. Since recieving therapy with her, she has taught me to work on my own self worth and self care. Thanks to her and this forum, I have walked away and let go some of the unhealthy people in my life of whom I have held on too for a very long time.  Every week, she says a lot of powerful and encouraging words. Thanks to her, I've managed to start being kinder to myself and to start feeling worthy. I've worked on healthy relationships at work with my colleagues.  I have opened about my abuse.  Our therapy session this week, I felt I had opened up a lot. Still continue to not look after myself in areas. My therapist quite fondly and pointed out, I am a worthy person. I am important. Those were the first words said at the beginning of our session. That encouraged me to open up and share.  She frankly pointed out, that she feels she can connect to me sometimes and other times, I back off and put up a wall. Then she doesn't feel connected. I thanked her for being open to me. This has hit a nerve greatly. Because this is a huge barrier for me which is why I don't form healthy relationships. This is the killer.  I don't know what a healthy relationship is. I don't know what it feels like. I don't feel safe with it. I feel great when I connect with people at first and then the fear steps in, then I back away. My relationship with my therapist is the first one I feel someone is truly listening. Has good intentions. Caring. Wants to help me. When I come away from our sessions, I feel worthy. That's not what I'm used too. Someone is begining to remove the bricks from my wall.  Can anyone advise on what a healthy relationship is? Looks like? How to trust others and let down your wall?  I don't have a clue!"

Your therapist sounds impressive to me. I understand much of what you said such as the wall that therapists talk about. Sometimes i think that is referred to as rapport, but i might be wrong.  Relationships are not my strong point, but i have some people in my life who set a good example of what that is. Do you have people in your life that are a good role model? It might help to observe marriages, parent/child relationships, friendships both formal and not. The whole area is complex and it is difficult for some people to work out how they should act in the different ones. It is all the more confusing when people tell you to just be yourself, because you cannot be the same version of you in all scenarios.

Hi @CoryTrevor From www.sane.org: It can take up to six weeks after the first dose of medication before it has an antidepressant effect. For some people it can take up to eight weeks or a little longer before they start to feel better, and the maximum benefit is felt after six months. Antidepressant medication is generally very effective."

Thank you for the book recommendation. I've been meaning to find some good material. I will start here with this book. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

It was hard...really difficult to accept. And not just this, but grieving for the person I used to be and probably would never be again.  It's not all bad though ok. Along your journey of recovery you'll have ah-ha moments...little treasures of truth that bring you into the light. These are usually based on 'your' truth, not that of others you've let into your world. In time, when recovery seems to be your daily reality, you'll be a better version of yourself than you ever were! What a great goal!  It's ok if you fight it too. You'll know when the time's right. Each person's different so don't go comparing yourself with others. I like to say that we're perfectly flawed in our own special way.

1705,Depression Forum,257952,I don't know what to do - wondering if anyone can offer some advice?,2020-02-08T13:08:00+0000,author,True,87202,London,Ella_fred,"I have always probably had minor forms of anxiety, which have manifested themselves in a few ways throughout my life, however I was first confronted by mental health problems in a more serious way, these past few years, such as anxiety and depression. I feel like my issues and reasoning perhaps are not as ""legitimate"" as other people's problems, which is what annoys me and also prevents me from talking to my mum about it, or seeking out professional help. I know it sounds silly and not like a normal, conventional problem, which is what frustrates me and annoys me as usually finding common ground with people is a good way to move past and heal from things. A few years ago, at the end of 2017, a bit of my hair was ripped out by a rucksack, and i then started to stress about it as I think that I thought it made a big difference, although no one probably noticed, but it was just my anxiety manifesting itself. My hair then did begin to fall out, and we visited the doctors, and it was nothing to do with iron deficiency etc, so they concluded that it must be stress, and although I had mocks at that time, I concluded it was because of the situation with the hair. It is now a few years later, 2 years, and my anxiety has just been increasing and has been at its worst these past few years, but most of all, I just really hate the way I look, and feel like I don't look like myself. There is constant reminders of self love and self worth today and how important this is, and obviously I would like to love myself and the way I look - I am so jealous of all my friends who feel pretty, not in a narcissistic way, but just normal, as people can look in the mirror and feel nice. I remember how that used to feel, but I just never feel that anymore - I feel like I look different, and I hate the way I look, I hate most photos etc, and I just don't feel like I look like myself at all. I know it sounds like such a narcissistic and egotistical problem, but I just want to feel like I actually look like myself, and I don't want to miss the way I used to feel about myself. I knew that it was bad when a few years ago, or perhaps last year, I started wishing that other things had happened instead of this such as a member of my family dying - I love my family so much, so the fact that I started wishing that in a twisted way as it seemed like something I would be able to get through, rather than this, is extremely problematic and I knew that, but it was just a symptom of the situation. When I was younger, not younger but a few years ago, I would look forward to the future, ""dream"" of it, and versions that seemed appealing, in order to deal with the present, which I feel is quite a conventional method of self- motivation for many people, however now I do not feel like I am permitted to that, I can't quite explain it, but I can't do that any more. This is incredibly inarticulate, as I never really speak about it, and this has been quite hard, however definitely writing this is the first of many steps. I just get annoyed as I have the best friends in the world, I love my school, and I love my family - so I just want it all to be right, I don't quite know how to end this and I have explained this all very badly, but I am just wondering if anyone has ever gone through anything similar or has any advice? Thanks"

I hate being in photos, too. I hate seeing myself in general.  I think you need to really look at your self-esteem, try to figure out where this is coming from. Like figure out why you don't see what others do.  I find writing out, and rewriting, like it was an essay, what is bothering me, and why I think it's happening, really helps me sort out my thoughts on an issue. Like, making it so it makes sense to an outsider is a good way to make it more clear for yourself.  Also - I'm jealous you can spell narcissistic correctly and repeatedly."

The relationship went through the honeymoon period where everything felt perfect she chased after me as I was the one avoiding love due to the pain I once felt before of a broken heart and wanted to avoid feeling again at all cost, this I did explain to her as well. As time past we became best friends and eventually it became love, love that made us inseparable we did everything together and everyday she wld remind me of how much she’s loves me.  About 8 months into the relationship things took a bit of a turn for the worst as arguments started and feelings of insecurities came into play during this there were 2 deaths in her family and at her young age she was stuck with the responsibilities of taking care of her family which put some distance between us and caused her to go back into a bad head space.  The last time we been together was the last weekend in January where she came over and spend the night as she states only when she is with me she seem to be happy. Three days later we had a bit of an argument about the future and how we were going to get this that and the other sorted and how we know it’s love. The question caused and over reaction from me as I did not understand her condition as it never got this bad, she then called the relationship off and left me in the dark.  As I cld not understand the situation and the behavior I let the pain of rejection and her saying I don’t think I love you anymore I can’t feel anything towards you she feels numb on the inside, due to not having any education of the illness I replied defensive more than understanding as I was hurt by those words beyond measure as I cld not understand how you can go from practically insisting I don’t leave how special I am to 4 days later you don’t have feelings your not happy I’m way more than she deserves and it wld be easier if I walk away  I guess the reason I’m here is to get an answer to weather or not this goes along with depression and is her attitude towards me her or the depression because not in a million years do I know this new person she have become and why do she feel more guilt with memories than love.  We have not spoken in a week or two I’m still devastated I have no real answers she says she can’t explain her taughts and when she is mentally strong she will let me know but as for now she needs to be alone and find herself said she is speaking to a therapist who told her she never dealt with what happened to her as a kid or with the miscarriage"

Try not to push your girlfriend, you cannot solve her problems from the past. In the best case, you can give her some degree of support, but only if she accept this support. It is not advisable to force one to accept support. And one must be prepared that once the depresion hit, a relation will be not the same as before, the recovery of the person with depresion would take a rather long time and the road to recovery is bumpy and with no guarantees."

When a person is sick he doesn't want to do anything, including working for a relationship. Maybe your girlfriend does nothing and you think she does not love you anymore. In any case, when a person is depressed he needs professional help. My boyfriend was depressed. This greatly spoiled our relationship. We went to a psychologist together, I learned to understand him and his condition. He went to psychotherapy twice a week and took special pills (not antidepressants, but smart pills), it helped him. It seems to me that now our relations have become much better. We began to understand each other better and trust each other. Maybe you should also go to therapy for couples?"

We been in a similar position before and when she came out the episode she thank me for not giving up and fighting for her but this time it feels a lot more real and like she some how blames me  She is currently going through a hell of a lot with her family where they constantly rely on her and I believe for some reason she think she had to choose between her family and myself but I told her before I understand and will be here and willing to support her through it all even tho sometimes I really miss her and wld insist on seeing her. She constantly says it’s not me it’s her but it was never just her to me it was us.

Are you able to elaborate on your depression? Are you stressed due to workload at uni? Are you a long way from friends / family? Sorry to ask but are you taking any drugs (quite common at uni / cannabis etc)? I think your friend is absolutely right that you should go and see your GP. I did and was prescribed antidepressants and enrolled on a therapy course. It's nothing to be ashamed of and the most important thing is that you do all you can to help yourself overcome this. You must not suffer in silence as you will be consumed. Friends and family are very understanding and whilst I found it a bit embarrassing to open up to the same, I'm so glad I did. You need to try and pinpoint what it is that's making you feel this way - and be completely honest with yourself. There is no point starting the healing process unless you are. I found the sertraline helped tremendously with my depression but I am suffering from depersonalisation so have now come off them as they can be a cause of this. Your GP will know what you need but you must open up to them. Good luck and feel free to reply to this post"

Through this I soon lost most of my friends at uni, with them going on and finding other people to spend more time with. I haven't taken any drugs, but sometimes drink a little too much to try and find a happy place. I tried too long to help myself without getting help from anyone else, and kind of did get consumed. My family couldn't really care less which is why I don't really involve them with much, probably the best. I have been quite open with one friend who isn't from uni, but met through other circumstances and it helps talking and helps to make each day a little less than a disaster."

It sounds like you are just a little lost at the moment but it's never too late to seek help and I think it's imperative you do. A problem shared is a problem halved an all that. It's a shame you feel your family don't care enough to listen / help but this is all the more reason why you should seek professional help. There's a bit of a stigma attached to mental health issues, particularly for us blokes but they way I looked at it was that we're only here once, these people are qualified to help and we'd be stupid to dismiss anything which is likely to help us. Once I opened up I could feel a weight lifted off my shoulders and I felt like I'd taken the first positive step towards recovery. You may find that by writing things down you can better manage your life. Make a list of what you think are the causes of your depression and then focus on each aspect and consider what you can do to help improve them. It takes time but progress, however gradual, is the road to recovery. You need to be totally honest and blunt with yourself when doing this. I never went to university myself but have worked in the same job for 20 plus years now and know how a high workload can make you feel like you're going under. I don't know at what stage you are at but could you speak to tutors to see if they can help you focus on the relevant areas / advise re revision methods? It is a horrible feeling when control is lost and if you're like me you feel like you're running round like a headless chicken and achieving nothing. There are reasons behind all our feelings and by recording these I find you can better focus on each one and make an attempt at improving them individually and as a result, collectively. Exercise helps tremendously and releases positive chemicals (endorphins?) into the brain, particularly in males apparently. Is this something you do / can see yourself doing? Make time to do the things you enjoy. It's good you have this friend to open up to. This is important and the genuine support of others helps spur you along. Good luck. Hope things improve for you."

In terms of work I have been booking odd days to give me long weekends etc.. but unfortunately I'm in a managers position which means I have to be there all the time and I also didn't really want to inform my boss as i've been aware of her views on mental health in the past and I think she would have a hard time understanding why I feel the way I do - I dont think she means it, but equally I would rather she didn't think any differently of me. I dont mean to come across so negative, I guess i'm just not coping well at the moment and dont know how to help myself get out of this, Only one friend I have understands and she is going through a particularly bad phase at the moment and I dont want to add to her stress by confiding in her. It was fine when it was just me that knew, but now others are noticing that i'm unhappy it's adding to my stress.  Sorry be be so negative in my writing, I know it's not the end of the world and worse things are happening. I just need to vent my feelings somewhere.  X"

Book yourself a proper holiday ortake a couple of weeks sick. Manager or not you need time to recover - the medication alone won't help you need to be good to yourself and have a pretty good support network. Your boss doesn't have to know that you're taking time off with depression, you can ask your doctor to put 'stress' on your sick note if need be (my mum did the same as her boss didn't have good views on MH). However, her views on mental health are irrelevant. It's true some people still think people with mental health problems are crazy but it is trying to be squashed and most work places have some sort of legislation in place to stop unfair treatment etc (or they should!)  As for your meds they will ask you to stick them out for at least 4-6 weeks so they can get into your system and have been given a chance to feel the effects. If you can stick them out until your review and then you can tell them they are making you feel ill and they'll try you on another one hopefully .  Take care"

I am due to visit my GP tomorrow to review the medication and just generally how I feel so I will see what she has to say. I do agree that I probably need more time off than 3 days, and I guess you are right my health needs to come first. I'm just very bad at thinking about myself I worry far too much about what others think or how work would be if I wasn't around for a couple of weeks. I guess i will just have to wait and see what tomorrow brings. Thank you everyone for your advice."
1733,Depression Forum,8670,Choosing a counsellor/therapist,2010-01-25T13:17:05+0000,author,True,4452,London,timB,"Hi all, I've been on Citalopram for over 4 weeks now for depression and if anything it's making things worse with regular bouts of suicidal thoughts and generally feeling worse than before I started. Although the GP has put me down as a priority for CBT I've still not got a start date. Rather than sink down further I've decided to try and find some help outside the NHS and to try and get some private counselling. I suspect the source of everything is low self esteem and confidence issues (which have resulted in a car crash mess of a life) so my gut feeling is I need to go for something on the psychodynamic lines. I've tried humanistic/person centred before and while it was a positive experience I gave it up as it wasn't really getting me where I felt I wanted to be at the time. Living in London I'm lucky in that there seems to be a lot of counsellors/therapists available but equally I'm a bit overwhelmed by the quantity of choice and the variety of approaches.  I was wondering what other peoples experiences have been with counselling to treat depression and what advice anyone has with regards to choosing and approach and a suitable counsellor?  Thanks, Tim"
1734,Depression Forum,8670,Choosing a counsellor/therapist,2010-01-25T19:16:40+0000,replier,False,4570,Hampshire UK,Spaceman,"Hi TimB  I would agree that looking for a counsellor can be a mind field. As someone in the know about counselling I can offer some words around my own experiences. There are many models out there and it depends on what you want. I know that I saw a great counsellor once who knew and would spout theory till the cows came home but all that did was for me to avoid the feelings, but going the other way and just dealing with the feelings didn't help me either because I need to latch it to theory. I needed a happy medium. Don't get me wrong they were both good counsellors but not suited to me!  I guess what I am trying to say is that all theories have their benefits and can be helpful but I am a great believer in two things. It depends on how you interact together with your counsellor, it is about the relationship. You must be able to trust them for you to be able to open up to them, if the relationship isn't there then it will be harder to do the work that is required. Secondly it is about how much you are prepared to give of yourself in the session, at the end of the day it will be you doing alot of the work with your counsellor facilitating you to gain the understanding and clarity you need to make the change you desire.  My suggestion would be to shop around. There are alot of good charitable agencies offering cheap counselling or you see someone private. But perhaps try them out and see how you go - hopefully you will find the right one for you.  You could also visit the BACP website www.bacp.co.uk which is very helpful in helping to find a counsellor or therapist. For peace of mind I would choose someone who is BACP or UKCP registered - this is like a Corgi registered electrician - if ensures they are qualified to a certain level and work to a code of ethics that protects you and them  Good luck with your quest  Spaceman"

Last night I felt really upset and depressed when I found out about it, and to add to it, it was just before I went to bed. What's going on in her head, is she evil or can anyone think of another idea about why I've been dumped? I think she's just evil, I can't get my head around any other reason why she has upset me. However this morning I don't feel upset anymore, it was a short lived thing, but I'm still confused, and I still think she's been malicious and there was no other reason for it. I wasn't after a relationship either, just a friend on facebook. Perhaps that's why I've got problems, my glass always seems half empty, but I can't help that, people should be more understanding about people like me."

I also do lots of things on my own, when I'm out I'm nearly always on my own; that in itself can be depressing. I don't work apart from voluntary, so don't meet many people that way. Luckily I do have some friends I can phone, though not that many. It doesn't help that I don't get on terribly well with people of the same gender, because I tend to dismiss them as social friends. I suppose the problem is that something can bottle up inside me and then when a friend dumps me, or something like that it brings out the worst in me and I get depressed. I do can see a logical reason that the lady may have dumped me, and I wouldn't call her evil for that reason. The problem is she obviously did something wrong to upset me, and I think that society has slowly become more thoughtless and cruel, and do things that hurt people without them even thinking about it. The tendency for me is to think that people are evil who are hard than understand the whole picture. My fear is that over the long term this incident might affect my ability to make facebook friends, but I have to remind myself that everyone is different. I'm still not sure how it will effect me long term. I know that certain incidents have effected my ability to try and make friends, the fear of being hurt is sometimes worse than the fear of not having friends. I keep thinking that people hate me/disgusted by me; sadly that is quite a normal thought for me."

Preferably, the fruits of our labour is tangible.  For me, work and choice are mutually exclusive. Unless you are incredibly lucky, you must consider pay and pay alone, the suitability of the job itself being a secondary and even tertiary consideration.  Work is a necessary evil, it is not who you are. Modern society does its damnedest to convince us otherwise but i just see this as a lie.

However I am having a depressive episode for the first time in my life for the last 25 days. I'm afraid to get onto antidepressants though I feel I can control the anxiety that seems to be 24 hours a day. The only thing I'm concerned about Side effects and withdrawn from the different anti-depressants. Does anyone know any antidepressants that work and have hardly any side effects were not addictive? I thought there must be new ones out like that?

You may only need to take the antidepressant for 6 months. Many are known to the doctor to have fewer side effects, and they aren't always the more modern ones. There are many different types and sometimes the first one doesn't work that well or side effects are not nice. I take Escitalopram 10mg and it is the best i have had. It may not work best for you though.  I think making an appointment with your doctor is a good idea as you don't have to feel this way. 25 days are 24 days too many. The longer it goes on, the worse it might get.   You also need to do a small amount of exercise like a daily short walk, and eat as healthily as you can.  What is your social life like?"

Most medications have some side effects so do your research before you agree to go on one. Usually you would be on antidepressants for 6-12 months. Depending on why your depressed maybe talking therapy would be better for you

I can't even get a doctor to take me seriously, they all just say that i must be lazy. I've worked 3 jobs at the same time in my past, literally working 21 hours a day... I'm definitely not just lazy!! For me, all i cab do is whatever i can do that day. Some days that means I'm making progress and some days it means that i made myself get up to pee. Everyday i remind myself that I'm doing the best i can that day. And i always tell myself that tomorrow night be better. I know nothing about meds for fatigue. I took Adderall and vyvanse because one psychiatrist said that would help with chronic fatigue but i couldnt see any improvement when i took them. I do think we have to be very patient with new meds of any kind. I do think it's important that you keep talking to the doctor ac keep advocating for a medicine that works for you"

I hope that the half-term break helps you to get back to a more positive place but it may be that you are still depressed in which case you should certainly go back to your GP (or whoever is your medical professional). It might be a good idea to see if you can get some help when the time does come for dealing with OH - from a union, friend, colleague, advocacy service or whoever.

It was the final medication review before I finally come off medication for good.  GP is happy with my progress. I appear to be more stable and recovering well with my depression and anxiety.  It's my decision to come off medication as I have been on Citalopram for one year and two months now. The longest time I have managed to stay on this medication. From 30mg to now 10mg.  GP has advised to spend the next two weeks taking medication for two days and then not take any on the third day. To repeat this pattern for two weeks. Then week 3 and week 4 - take meds on one day and then none for second day. To repeat this pattern until end of week four.  I have had depression and anxiety for a long time. I think since the age of 9. Been on and off Citalopram since 2009. But this time I have managed to stay on them for this length of time.  I'm happy I am on the last step towards recovery. But I have a strong feeling these next four weeks are going to be the most difficult part. 1) it might be feeling cold turkey as my body will need to adjust coming off medication for good 2) I may experience side effects.  I am worried in case I have a relapse. I'm scared I will fall apart. I'm scared of myself in case I lose control and end up back to square one.  Then I get angry with myself thinking of those who have used and abused me. I get angry for allowing myself being put in these situations. Which just ends up making me feel more low.  It's like I am my own worse enemy. I won't allow myself to get better. Like I deserve to rot and that I deserve to remain in this black hole.

I'm hoping posting on here might make me feel a bit better.  I'm a 29 year old bloke and have suffered from some mental health issues over the years. Last year, things came to a head and snow-balled, and even though I feel like I'm past the thick of it now, I still struggle and I'm still so angry.  Basically early last year I had a fall-out with my former best friend. She became controlling, possessive and seemed like she felt she could boss me around. I decided to walk away from her, and the wider friend group, as I began to realise how unhealthy it was. There were lots of things over the years I had swept under the rug - like when I came out to them in later years of high school and suffered months of homophobic bullying - but I guess it took me a long time to get the strength to walk away.  After this I found the lack of support from my family extremely difficult.

They had far more sympathy toward her than me. I also found it difficult as well because I tried multiple times to explain everything that had happened, and my mom would continuously forget, because she drinks so much.  I also decided around this time to stop drinking alcohol as it was not having a good effect on me. I'm 1 year sober now.

There's (obviously) a lot more stuff that I won't go into, but all of this is also on top of just not being taken remotely seriously by my family, and also by that toxic friend group in the past, even though I walked away. It's something that my partner has also picked up on. I just feel so, so, so, so angry. Angry at myself for letting people walk over me and not standing up for myself, and also angry at people as well.

It is not necessary to be Buddhist. Non-attachment to our feelings and using the awareness of impermanence are very useful. I remember being very angry. I was on the way to a talk in a library and 2 meditations by a Buddhist monk in the Tibetan tradition, in robes. After his talk and the 2 meditations my anger had completely gone and I was inwardly free. It may take a very long time to undo excessive anger feelings but the cognitive behavioural training in Buddhism is a sustained way of inwardly freeing us, and is far more effective than the clinical psychology medical route."

One could say, I got my own small community of depressed people.  Back to your anger issue: I had a lot of anger in myself, when I was younger. What actually helped me was to rationally think about: Why does that anger me? and Is it worth it? I - for myself - found out that most of the timne the anger is not worth it. Either you cannot do anything about it, or it is just not that big deal. Pretty sure that does not work for everybody though."

Add to that hostility and it can be one thing to deal with too many. Coming out is a thing, and the way we approach it can be the difference to forming allies to the opposite. Such a thing as coming out can be so over-whelming leaving no time/room to think beyond that as the coming-out is in itself over-whelming as it is... Add to that our insecurities etc. which will probably be blatantly obvious as we bear our soles in potentially our weakest moments of coming out, it can leave us as easy prey for those who have issues of their own Looking beyond feelings of betrayal, wronged etc. what does their behaviour say about their character? What is lacking in them to behave in that manner? Leaving go of the resentment, bitterness etc. can be a opportunity to look beyond the victim mind-set and build a more proportioned picture of what happened, the whys etc. the whats that can be gleaned from it all and the change in approaches to situations that can turn things completely around. Possibly the difference to being reactive to being in the driving seat. Hope this helps. One more thing talking about these things is always key."

I understand where you are coming from though, I get periods of feeling low all of the time. Things that I try and do are seeing family, especially the young ones because they are a much better distraction in my eyes. Treat myself to something new whether it be something small or big. Go out with either my boyfriend or friends. Set a new goal like college or a job. Try find a new hobby. I play keyboard and guitar which is a good distraction, especially trying to learn a new song. Everyone is different and these are a few things I try that sometimes help. I hope you are feeling better soon. Stay strong and be safe x"

I'm lucky to have a job, it makes me get up in the morning but when I have days off I just fall into a heap. I've been resisting very strong SH urges for a few weeks now, on my last days off I wrapped myself in a duvet for a whole day so that I wouldn't do anything stupid. I've started binging and purging again, almost because I'm trying not to SH I'm kidding myself into thinking I'm succeeding, but really I'm just punishing myself a different way. I'm letting everyone down and I should be happy right now.  I am taking fluoxetine and I upped it to 40mg last week, I'm not sure how long it will take for the higher dose to kick in but I could really use it right now.

At work, I have to be professional, smiling, on the ball, competent, etc but it REALLY takes it's toll. As soon as I get home, it's pjs and usually under the duvet.

And those thoughts of SH, suicide and my eating disorder surround me when I'm not busy, busy, busy. I'm glad you've got your duvet around you.

As LE says, it's good to have that self drive to make yourself do things because it's so easy to let time slip by and feel rubbish. I'm a musical director in my spare time and, when we are in the middle of rehearsals, the last thing I want to do is to go out to rehearsals in the evening. Work will have been tough enough so why do I want to go out again later that day? But once I'm there, I am usually pleased that I am. And I can completely relate to what LE said about not being signed off work. I desperately want to be at home all the time as I am tired and I don't want to pretend I'm fine and I want to hide. My CPN and I know that I'd be even worse. At least distraction helps a bit.  Getting that balance is important though - needing time out but not excessively. Do you have any interests or hobbies? With a new area, there might be something that you'd enjoy that, once you're there , will be a good place for you to be.  Always feel free to pm me  Kate x"

You're not alone in feeling that 'you're have no idea what's going on'. First of all, it's great that you've sought help and got diagnosed. Since you only have appointments in intervals of time, I suggest you try finding ways to find yourself again. Start simple. Maybe wake up everyday and write your goal for the day. Engange yourself with people. If you feel like getting a break from the people you know, that's okay. That's totally fine. Try finding a social activity work or any kind of activities so you can meet new people. In a way, you can see it as getting away from your life. But it's actually a great opportunity to find yourself.  I really hope you'll pull it through. You're not alone we've been there. And we're here for you"

So I ended my relationship recently because he is divorced and my mum has major issues with that and won’t accept him or be a part of anything to do with it. She has been absolutely horrible about it -her reactions involve screaming, shouting, being ott dramatic and saying awful things. She’s upset because of her own experiences which I’ve dragged up and are hurting her. I get that I really do but she’s projecting onto me and failing to put my happiness before her issues. I live with her so I’m surrounded by the tension and atmosphere it has caused daily. She’s only today speaking to me again properly; she really went into a rage on Tuesday and it’s really traumatised me.  On the other hand I’ve broken the heart of a good guy who loved me and only wanted to make me happy. He’s wonderful and really showed me what a great life I could have with him. He’s desperately hurt and I feel incredibly guilty and bad.  I’ve hurt them both and myself and what have I achieved? Diddly squat. Just heartache, sadness, despair, tears, anxiety and no will to live.  I dared to dream of happiness and life firmly put me back in my place.  Yes, I know I should just do what makes me happy and be with him but it’s complicated. I can only do it with the acceptance of my mum, I don’t want to it any other way. I can’t.  I’ve sacrificed but really don’t know how to live life like this now. I’ll never have pleasure in anything because I don’t want to move on. I’ll be alone and unhappy forever-and it’s all my fault..."

I don't know your age but am quite sure that you won't live with your mother forever and then the change of proximity will change the dynamic between the two of you. Distance between and virtual lack of contact with any of my family for several years has improved my life massively but only after years of suppression piled up through numerous in-laws acquired through multiple marriages (once was enough for me). I am permanently scarred by my experiences so can empathize to a degree but on a positive note - the present freedom has enabled me to heal considerably in recent years. Some families are just like this and if life has a meaning for me that meaning is that it is largely a lottery.

1997,Depression Forum,12728,I need to get help,2010-05-31T21:00:51+0100,author,True,8562,London,sipos,"Sorry this is kind of a long post.  I'm feeling at my wits end and, I can't go one feeling the way I do at the moment. I need to get some help and somehow do something about how I feel right now.  I'm a 26 year old man living in London. I live alone. I am doing research and working a my PhD.  I've been feeling really bad for quite some time but, it has got worse recently. I don't really know why (there is no reason why I should feel like this). I'm not sure if I'm depressed or what but, I feel down almost all of the time. I'm miserable and don't seem to enjoy anything. I feel very anxious a lot of the time but, I'm not sure what about. I hate myself. I'm lonely but, I don't tend to enjoy being around other people. I seem to spend most of my time upset and I don't want to see anyone. I feel like I don't want to live anymore.  I can't seem to summon any enthusiasm to do anything. My flat is a mess because I never tidy up. I can't be bothered to cook proper meals so I eat things that are easy to make and so, I have a terribly unhealthy diet. I do almost no exercise (despite desperately wanting to loose weight and wanting to do more). I'll go out when I have to but, most of the time, I just sit in my flat and feel like shit. Even when I need to go out, I find it difficult to actually summon the motivation to get dressed and go. I'm supposed to be writing up my thesis but, I don't seem to be able to actually motivate myself to do any work at the moment. Not doing things just makes me hate myself more.  I feel that somehow I need to escape feeling like this and, I often feel like I want to kill myself so, I won't have to feel like this anymore. I'm not about to do it and have never attempted suicide but, a few months ago, I planned to but never went through with it. When I'm feeling down I feel as though I want something to happen to kill me so I don't have to do it myself. If I'm crossing the road, I feel like I want something to come speeding round a corner, knock me down and kill me. Sometimes when I'm feeling really down, I cross the road without checking to see if anything is coming.  I think I've felt steadily worse for years but, recently, it seems to have become unbearable and I don't seem to be able to continue doing things I need to. Over the past year or so, I've tried to motivate myself to work more, do exercise, get involved in social activities more, change the way I think about myself etc. but, I've only felt worse and worse. It's becoming clear that I don't seem to be able to get myself out of this rut on my own and, it's only getting worse to the point where I can't cope.  I lived abroad until about 6 weeks ago. I had to be there to do research but, didn't really like living there. I (rather unrealistically) hopped that moving back to the UK, I would be able to change things and I kind of pinned my hopes on this happening but, things are still as bad as before and now I don't know what to do. I feel that I can't go on like this anymore and my life is falling apart. I will probably not be able to finish my PhD unless I can overcome my complete lack of motivation quite soon and, I am missing deadlines for submitting chapters of my thesis to my supervisor and, preparing work for conferences. I'm not sure what I can say about this but, I still don't seem to be able to do this work. I don't know why it is just making me more stressed.  I don't really want to discuss how I feel with friends or family. I have tried talking to friends about feeling down but, it doesn't seem to help much and just makes me feel worse. Mostly, I just try to put on a positive attitude and avoid seeing anyone when I feel most down. I feel that if I am anywhere close to honest about how bad I feel, that it will just shock them and I won't be able to interact with them normally afterwards. When I have tried to discuss how I feel, I have just regretted it later. I have no idea how I would begin to tell my friends and family how I really feel. I think I need help from someone who I don't otherwise have contact with.  I would appreciate some advice from people about where to go. There is a counseling service provided by the university. I could make an appointment there. I've also read that GPs can help (or point you to someone who can help) with depression. Maybe just discussing things on forums might help.  I don't really want to go to my GP. They've been pretty unhelpful in the past, I really don't like going and, I also worry a bit about things like getting insurance if I am diagnosed with something by a doctor. I think I should probably make an appointment to see the university counselor. I'm worried about what it might be like though. I think I would find it very difficult to sit and describe to someone how I feel and I don't know if I would be able to handle it. I can't really picture how that would go. Has anyone been to something like that before? How was it?"

I think it would be a good idea from what you've wrote to get some help. Counsellors won't make you talk about anything you don't want to talk about, they're there to listen to anything you want to talk about. It's like anything you do for the first time, it takes a while to get used to and learn what to do. Although, there is no right way to be counselled, just do what you feel comforable with. I hope you get some help and that it works, and if it doesn't work straight away, don't be disapointed, keep trying."
1999,Depression Forum,12728,I need to get help,2010-06-01T04:01:29+0100,replier,False,1,The World,mischief,"Hi Sipos  Welcome to the forum!  Doing a PhD is a stressful occupation! Doing one away from where you come from is even more stressful and a fair guess is that doing your field work overseas is even more stressful. While I haven't got there myself yet one of the things all PhD students I speak to who have got to that stage tell me about is the difficulties in writing the thesis.  Doing a PhD you need both the will to keep interested in your subject area for a number of years (3-4 years for full time students) and then you have the challenge of doing all the work required within a PhD, much of which is mundane and just has to be done. Both elements in themselves are incredibly mentally demanding. Then there is the whole aspect of academic politics, keeping your supervisors and the university happy. The number of strategies one has to have is large!  One thought it might be worth re-reading some of those books about doing a PhD. I don't have one with me at the moment however they often spend time talking about some of the emotional challenges of doing a PhD. One good one is: http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Get-PhD-Handbook-Supervisors/dp/033520550X  I think if you were to see the university counsellors you'd probably find that a large number of post graduate students go through similar issues and that you're not alone in facing this. PhDs are notoriously lonely things to do.  As to seeing a counsellor, they could work through with you the issues you are facing, both with the practical issues like how are you going to negotiate the situation with your supervisors and what can you do about the emotional issues you are facing. You have written out your experiences really well in the post, you could take the post with you and give it to them to read to start off with to help set the scene. If you are at a university it is usually a much easier way of seeing a counsellor than going through your local doctor.  Does the University have a health service? When I last went to my university medical service I received the best medical service I ever have.  One of the issues you might like to explore with a doctor is whether it is a physical health issue or an emotional issue. I suggest the possibility of it being a physical health issue because it may be, for example, a sleep disorder. Many people have obstructive sleep apnoea, which may account for some of your symptoms. Many people with sleep apnoea also experience depression.  In my experience it is about finding the approach which works best for you! You need to give things a go and see how they work for you.  One option you might want to consider is just taking a month or a 3 months break from your studies. Most PhD programmes have a set number of months to complete your programme in, however often you can suspend your studies for a period which doesn't actually count towards the x months to complete.  Having taken time off myself the messages I have received from my supervisors and other academics is that the key is keeping your supervisors informed, the sooner you can do that the better, and if you can keep in touch with them if you take time off you'll find it much easier to return.  I'm not sure this answers any of your questions! However I hope it is useful.  Good luck"

I'm mot saying she was a Golddigger but she wasnt't messin with no broke nigger"". (which is no reason to be depressed either}. As for me I find it hard to be depressed after 56 years of dealing with auditory hallucinations. The only idiots that I seem to encounter all seem to be in my head.

I have e-mailed to ask for an appointment with the university counselor. Hopefully this will help sort things out.  I think it is worth considering taking a break from my PhD. I will discuss it when I see the counselor. I don't think it is the reason I feel like this (or, at least, not the only reason). I've felt terrible even when I wasn't stressed about it. I enjoyed it when I started and, I often felt down then (though, not as often or nearly as bad as now). To be honest, I have lost interest in most things and there's not really anything I'd prefer to be doing so, I don't know how much it has to do with the subject itself and how much is just a general lack of enthusiasm for anything.  I hadn't thought about a physical cause. I probably do need to go to the doctor to check for something like that out. As I said, I don't really like it going to the doctor (actually, it's a bit more than that, I avoid going to the doctor whenever possible and it's probably something I need to discuss with the counselor too). There is a university health center. The GP I am registered with is the one there. If I go to the GP, I think that I will probably change to another one because I have had some less than positive experiences seeing them before and, I think I'd find it easier to go to a different one."

Are you moving out of the city? Moving anywhere, a big change like that, can be difficult. It takes a bit of time to settle into a new routine, sleep well again and get to know our new area.  it is quite exciting though, new bus or train journeys and new leisure places to go. Due to covid, it is not as easy but finding where places are like the pool, supermarket, park, is a good start. For me, it is the nearest coffee place!  Eventually you might see notice boards in the library or supermarket, telling you what is going on in the area. You might have a free local mag coming through your letterbox telling you what is going on in the area too.  You can go on the website of the new place you live in a see what is going on. A visit x town sort of site. Tourism sites."

I still suffer from depression and anxiety. It does lesson the effects of them however, it helps me when they are at their worst, it does nothing for my ocd, but that's the least of my worries.  I have been to see a therapist a couple of times but i find it really hard to talk to them. I find it easier to read about depression and anxiety, have a few good books. I feel like i have no choice but to take them, otherwise it is seen as i am making no effort to help myself, i have really bad periods of depression, and i have a ten year old son.  I have decided to look into alternatives ways to manage my depression and anxiety. I think this is the first time i have really thought about my depression and anxiety. I have wasted ten years of my life trying to fight it. I need to accept that depression and anxiety are part of my life, and that i am going to have good and bad periods, but that i can still have a good life.  Sorry i went a bit of topic."

You can buy them in good health food shops. Magnesium deficiencies have been linked to depression, anxiety, hypomania, sleeplessness, poor eating habits etc. It is known as the ""original chill pill"" - I take it mainly for the benefit of my skin.  I know I have not been chilled lately, lol, but I feel it does help my complexion as I have had problems with that.

As for me, I have been on these drugs for about 6 weeks, so I for one would be worried about coming off them quickly without consulting my doctor. Of course, you think the doctors are a bit corrupt too, maybe you would say that, but I have to put that back into the controversial box too. It's a bit like room 101, the controversial box haha. Maybe they should make a tv program about that too, lol. I think I agree with CPU, it's better for the majority of us that we aren't given the blow by blow of what the dangers for the brain and internal organs are. Maybe there are a lot of people who are of the opinion that we are better without any drug whatsoever, caffeine included, because any drug can be seen as a poison whatever it is, but that doesn't stop people from taking them. It might be a fact they would be better off without all of them, but for one reason or another, people like their poison dip. A good example of a poison is tobacco smoking of course, how many of them wish to know about all the minute details of how it will be harming them? Maybe in the same way it applies to psychiatric drugs. I'm just going to take my doctors opinion I think, I'm going to stick my neck out and argue that 'the doctor knows best'.

In reality it stops you fully comprehending the nature of your problems. They can induce chronic apathy and that is their function, essentially, to reduce distress.  The brain shrinks. Grey matter is reduced. The cerebral cortex and other regions of the brain are often damaged irreparably. This is what causes Parkinson's disease and other anti-psychotic induced movement disorders. Anti-psychotics cause insulin resistance which often gives people diabetes or leaves a person in a pre-diabetic state where they have unstable blood glucose, fat deposits, and extreme food cravings. They stunt your energy levels so you can become chronically fatigued. They can cause water retention and blood pressure problems.  Over time the liver can become stressed processing the drugs and fatty liver, heart, and kidney problems can develop as a consequence. With clozapine (which causes extreme constipation) - bowel blockages can develop, which can potentially be fatal. Clozapine also comes with a black box warning for agranulatyosis (leukaemia essentially), and also carries numerous other warnings including an increased risk of dementia.  I could go on but I won't. They are very dangerous drugs and not to be messed with and people should know the risks."

I told him what I was taking and contrary to the above he said that the drug CPZ was safe. He told me to double the dose to 100mg which I can do tonight as he gave me a prescription for 2 weeks supply, then he said that if I could I should increase it to 150mg after. I feel happy with this decision, I'm quite happy to take his advise this time around. I asked him about the various drugs and he said the newer drugs were easier to tolerate, but they had side effects like weight gain and apathy. The main problem with Chlorpromazine is that it causes rigidity but he didn't mention brain damage or anything. He told me I could take a procyclidine tablet twice a day in case the rigidity sets in, which he said it might at 100mg. I'm not sure how easy it will be to tolerate 100mg, 50mg seems bearable, but I've been on drugs for around 6 weeks and I'm happy to go on with them a bit more. He's happy to keep the sertraline antidepressant, so I will have another go with this at 50mg. He seemed a good doctor, a very pleasant chap."

I also find that having had past episodes of depression, i for some reason feel bad about myself because it is as though i've failed at life and will never be competent at things again. It could just be you have low self esteem from past experiences and it has nothing to do with your depression though. I think the only way to fix low self esteem is to have positive experiences and achievements that make you feel better about yourself. It is a risk to put yourself out there because ofcourse the opposite could happen, you could fail again at something therefore confirming that negative view of yourself. I think choosing carefully what you do day to day, just taking things slow and easy, is the best way to go."

I feel so down most of the time because I can't even say three god things about myself... Even if I know them I can't believe it is true.. Help or advice will be appreciated.. thank you  A psychologist told me a couple of things which maybe would be helpful. One idea is to find a 'role model' - look in a magazine and cut out a picture of someone who you would like as a role model - who would see the best in you and encourage you. Then you can ask the role model questions or for advice - and write down what you think your role model would say.  Another exercise is to stand in front of the mirror and affirm yourself by being your own best friend - for example, saying 'you're a good person' or 'you're ok' to yourself, or by stating 'I approve of and accept myself' - only do this when you can say positive things, never say negative things. There is the book You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay, which has ideas for other affirmations. At first, you may have trouble believing good things that you say about yourself like being a kind person, but the idea is to keep going and do it regularly.  I can relate to what you've posted, so will be interested to know if other people have got different ideas that might help too.  Also, I noticed that you made a judgement about yourself 'all I do ends up as a failure' - but there are things that you do that are successful - for example, it might be making something nice to eat, or helping someone by giving them directions, or managing your bill payments, so you could begin by acknowledging the things that you are doing that are working, no matter if they seem like small achievements. I think there is a saying along the lines of not despising the day of small beginnings.  You may not have experienced enough 'validation' and 'affirmation' from role models when you were growing up, but you can begin turning things round by positive self-talk - 'well done ...', 'I am a capable person', 'l am a valuable person'.  I understand that it can seem daunting - I'm in a similar situation."

Darky - set your self goals/targets, it could be weight loss, could be workouts, could be running certain distances or even walking certain distances, could be going a period of time without alcohol/caffeiine etc, could be any number of things, but every time you reach a target it registers as a success and you will feel a positive from that which may improve self esteem.

The reason behind my low self esteem is that I did all this I tried it It worked and I couldn't keep it..  I lost 20 kg working hard and gained them all back in no time... due to experiences beyond my control.. I had the highest marks n Uni.. and all financial problems and personal problems seems to be so overwhelming that can't put the effort to do it even though I used to love it... I had the dream job and I lost it.. because a colleague was taking the piss and I just couldn't hold the emotional response... It is just every time when I am happy about something .. something will happen and ruin my happiness... The fact that I experience every single emotion extremely intense and often take everything personal doesn't help either.. And I know I am the only person who can change it.. even if I am positive and on track for few days something will happen and I will lose it... It is like a circle ... and I can't break it... I know I will have to do jobs that I hate sometimes it is not only me... but it is like it is only me who cannot control and hide the awful way I feel about the work and I lose it.... I was working as a cleaner a year ago and there was no day that I was not crying after work... it was extremely physically demanding.. supervisors hated me... colleagues didn't like me... it was stressing me out and I hated the job itself.... eventually I lost it and things got worse because of finances... Same thing happened a month ago n I lost my job that I used to enjoy... and I couldn't take anymore the behavior of the guy I was working with... My family have never been supporting... not emotionally I had to get over a lot of things on my own and I know is definitely part of the issue but every time when I find something I am good at and I believe I am.. either something will happen or someone will turn up and just make me feel that I am not good even for this... And the fact that I am so emotional is like a blessing at the same time.... I can sit and cry my heart out with a stranger.... which will maybe make them feel they are not alone.. but at the same time I will react to intensely to criticism and I will lose my job... I have no friends to talk to.. I m not good in even making friendships... My partner is too fed up of listening to me... And it is just I have conversations on m own with myself all the time which doesn't help for my confidence or self esteem.. I feel so lost...

It is hard to try to think positively sometimes but we have to try hard to be kind to ourselves when reviewing our past. It is easy to say these things, these negative things, and your thinking is very negative right now, you might say realistic but i think negative, but we have to say sometimes that this happened because i was depressed, or that happened because i was unable to handle such and such. I know what i'm trying to say but it is hard to put into words, basically we have to be kind about ourselves when talking about our past, it helps not to beat yourself up about everything that has gone wrong, not that you have done wrong."

I feel like I have so much on my shoulders handling the finances for us both and a job that I am just crumbling.

As I've been saying for several years now, if people want to understand how Nazi Germany could ever have happened, just take a fucking look around you - this is how; the stirring of intranational hatred towards anyone who's 'different' (whether that be racially, religiously, or simply in that they're seen to not be 'pulling their weight'), and the cultivation of a put-upon nationalism whereby people become convinced that the country could be 'great again' if only Johnny Foreigner wasn't actively working to keep us down.  Such hysterical and bombastic rhetoric, repeated in perpetuity by a compliant media, provokes dehumanisation of 'The Other', which is a crucial step because once 'The Other' becomes seen as less than human, the attitude towards their lives becomes very cheap... at best the wider public doesn't particularly care what happens to them, and therefore look the other way when the worst happens, by which I mean people taking it upon themselves to harm, and even kill, the 'vermin' and 'parasites' around them.  I do believe that the British and American publics are nasty and dumb enough to let it happen... in Britain we happily returned a political party to power that believes starvation - a punishment that would be illegal to inflict upon murderers and rapists in prisons - is an acceptable tactic to use against the horrific 'crimes' of being unemployed, chronically ill, or disabled, while America allowed itself to be seduced by a quasi-fascist who's seemingly making it up as he goes along.  I mean, putting a thin-skinned man-child, with the impulse control of an adolescent, in charge of the world's second biggest nuclear arsenal... great idea;what could possibly go wrong? I wouldn't be entirely surprised if he 'jokingly' threatens to nuke a country because too many people from that nation start criticising him on Twitter."

It doesn't mean people don't like you. For me, i like to be able to post on here and be more honest on here than i am with people in my real life. Im not sure i would ever want to blur the boundaries . So don't give up, there is so many friends out there for you....you just haven't met them yet....but you will soon x"

All she seems to do is listen, she seems reluctant to offer advice,  They're not actually supposed to offer advice - that's not their role. They are there to just sit and listen. I tihnk the idea is they help you explore stuff and figure stuff out for yourself rather than sit there telling you what to do. Saying that though, they are people, just like you and me are, and we're not going to get on with everyone we meet in life, whether therapist or not. Just cos someone is a therapist, doesn't mean we're going to automatically get on with them. It's ok not to get on with them. I didn't with my first therapist - was like talking to a blank wall. Nothing...... just nothing back. Fortunately i only had 8 sessions with her and then was referred on to the current one, who i get on really well with.  Maybe you could take a risk and say to him/her when they've upset you and what you're finding hard? I did it a couple of times with my woman, and it was really hard to do, but ultimately a good thing i think as it meant there was honesty in the relationship. If you don't say anything, they think the session's gone well, you know it hasn't, and it doesn't really do either of you any good. Just a thought."

I thought it was because I had a bad therapist. I realized later I was upset at the things she was making me look at and explore. I saw her for 8 years. If I had switched to a ""kinder"" therapist I would never have made the progress I made. She challenged me and that's what a good therapist does. They aren't your friend. A friend gives you advice. A therapist challenges you and promotes personal growth and exploration."

It would be interesting to find out which modality your therapist is using, and verify that she is actually trained in that modality. She might be highly qualified in something else entirely.  Some therapists make themselves deliberately difficult to relate to, and therapy like this will make anyone upset. Also, it tends to take a very long time. 8 years is not uncommon. And it often fails to do any good at all. Because it takes so long and it so often doesn't work, this kind of therapy is rarely used these days.  Most therapists these days try to be warm and understanding. If that's all they do, this kind of therapy can take just a few years.  When therapists are warm and understanding, and when they also share their own expertise with you, then therapy is much quicker and much more successful. These kinds of therapy include CBT. They tend to take just months or weeks, and they have good success rates.  If you have just 7 sessions left, the only kind of therapy that will have any effect at all in that time will require the therapist to form a close relationship with you and share her expertise. As she is not willing to do either of those things, the 7 sessions will be a waste of your time and hers, in my opinion. Cancel them, I would say, and consider making a formal complaint about her apparent lack of skill."

In my situation, i spoke to someone else so i didn't have to confront the counsellor myself - I find confrontation incredibly difficult. That said, it doesn't have to confrontation. It's you being assertive and making sure that you make the most of such the valuable time. I would be pretty certain that virtually all therapists would have experience where a useful relationship isn't forged and, at the end of the day, she'd want what's best for you.  Sounds like you know what you want to do and it's now making it happen. Hopefully you'll feel a real sense of relief. You can do it?  Hugs Xx"

I don't think that therapy has worked very well for me so far and I've had several months of it before the present one. I saw the lady that I am seeing now for several months last year and at the beginning of this. I don't think she's been able to offer one piece of advice or say anything which has helped me subsequently. I think that the most important role of the therapist is to be understanding. I think the trouble with this one is that she isn't willing to come down to my level, she sits on a fence as it were. When she offers any sort of advice or questions what I've said it tends to be against a belief which I have no trouble in believing which is probably why I tend to get upset; she seems to miss the beliefs that I do have more problems with and would prefer questions at that level. Another thing is that they should also offer human warmth, and I feel I can't even ask the therapist questions about herself; also if I ask her a question about what I've said her reply is generally 'it's what you think that counts'. I still feel I need to cancel the remaining sessions, I don't need to be upset. I also wish she would cheer up, sometimes it's like she's acting like a lawyer rather than a therapist, I think she needs to be a little less serious. I'm probably going to phone the centre today, I'm not sure whether to say I want to just stop or to see a different therapist. I know what I should say: I want a different one. The therapist I do see is more qualified than a lot of the others ther, but it doesn't seem to mean a lot in her case."

Therapists aren't supposed to tell you what they think - about anything, themselves, or you. If you ask a therapist what they think you should do about X, they wont (or shouldn't) tell you. If they do that, then it's you taking on their opinion - which may not be right for you - rather than you figuring it out yourself. It has to come from you - from the inside, not from them on the outside.  Sometimes we do need to be upset in therapy, much as we hate it. Therapy is all about making you feel better in the long run, but as both my therapist and psychiatrist said, often it gets worse before it gets better."

I went in with shy, scared, embarrassed but with an open mind and determined honesty to not hold anything back from her. I had great success taking this approach. She definately offered more suggestions, offered beneficial reading materials and taught me many coping skills and self-help mechanizms that worked outside the office and helped me become much more self aware and could do it without being overwhelmed.

To give you an example I said to her that I don't ride my bicycle, one of the reasons is because I feel awkward on it. She wouldn't give no for an answer and quizzed me about it: 'I thought cycling was becoming more popular/why should you feel awkward riding a bike, etc.' In the end I had to give her all the nitty-gritty details about why I didn't ride a bike, it's not a pleasant form of transport for some, she must already know that. I wish I hadn't bough the bike actually. To be honest she just wound me up. It was one reason why I felt upset for the remainder of the session, and I bottled it up. I just think she's a bad therapist, and she's created an atmosphere where I can't even ask her something like 'how are you finding the weather' or 'are you enjoying the Olympics'. I feel I just need a fresh start with a different therapist, I've already seen this one too many times in the past. Why has it always got to be her I wonder? In fact I found out from my surgery that there is somewhere else that does psychotherapy in my area, so I have contacted them already, you can even self-refer.

If I was trying to give someone therapy I would be trying to offer some advice, I wouldn't be forcing it down their throats but I would be trying to offer someone perhaps a push in the right direction. But what is the 'right direction'? And who's right direction is it? If the therapist is trying to push someone in a right direction, it might be their direction, and not what's right for the client. For example, say you're not sure about your sexuality, and you talk about it with your therapist. Now the therapist might have issues of their own regarding sexuality, and by offering you advice they can influence you (consciously or not) in a certain way. So you might get the impression from them that being gay is wrong, for example, so you think 'Well i'd better not be gay then', even if you are pretty sure you are gay. The therapist should not offer advice - they should help you figure out what's right for you - whether they agree that being gay is ok or not.  I think as well that a lot of the time we're vey good at deluding ourselves of things. There's stuff we know isn't right with us, but we ignore it, pretend it's ok etc cos it's easier. Doing that doesn't cause us emotional pain, it doesn't make us face things about ourselves that we might not like. Therapists challenge those things and can help us deal with them, face them , develop our ideas about them. It can be painful and horrible, but in my experience (and i'm only writing from my own experience here), it is worth it.  Yup, there are bad therapists out there, just like there are bad doctors / policemen / teachers / etc.... Yours does sound a bit odd - especially all the questions she asked you about riding your bike. That does all seem a bit 'dog with a bone' ish and not very helpful. In instances like that it seems better to stop - good on you for taking that step and finding someone else."

It seems a bit like religion to me - you can go along with all the stuff and say the prayers and sing the songs (if there are songs!) and do the rituals, but if you don't believe it internally, does it have the same effect? Surely there has to be some connection between what you're hearing / doing and what's going on inside you?  I have psychodynamic psychotherapy. It's been going for about 18 months now. The therapist is not particularly distant - i feel like i'm talking to another human being rather than a black wall or a mirror - and i have to say i've found it incredibly good for me.

I saw my therapist again on Thursday for 45 minutes to discuss why I didn't want to continue with the sessions. I asked her why she had questioned that I was wearing my England tea-shirt the week before, and she said it was worth exploring because as I had worn it during the Olympics, it might mean that I wanted to be part of a different sort of community, and perhaps want to move out of my area. She seemed to think there could be a connection between the two! I also asked her why she had questioned me about the bike and she said it was very worth exploring because of what that could lead to, and that the sort of argument that followed was in my best interests (even though I had told her that it had rather wound me up). I also said that she had upset me the week before, and she often seemed too serious, and that the previous therapist had never upset me like that; her answer to that was that I had already told her before that the previous therapist had upset me, and she said she was certain of it. When I said I would prefer a different therapist she smiled at me and said that she would recommend that I always had her, either now or as long as she was working there; she also said that I would have to complain in writing if I wanted to try to get that over-turned; she said she knew me better than anyone else in that centre, and felt that there would be a chance that any therapist would upset me so there was no point in changing. She also implied that it was my depression causing me to be upset rather than her. I told her that I would be seeing someone in a different building next week, and she seemed to think that once they knew that I had seen her, they'll recommend me back to her. What she said in the session, which lasted 45 minutes, just proved to me that I'm right to find another therapist, I don't think she would be allowed to block my request to see a different one if my psychiatrist felt I really needed help from therapy. She seemed very keen for me to carry on with more sessions with her at every stage. She wants to write to my doctor about it, she said she would let me read her letter first, then wants me to let her know if I would like her to send it to my doctors. Does anyone have any ideas about her, and have any ideas about what I could do?"

You're absolutely right. Suppose, for example, you hear a dog barking. A split second after you hear the noise, you know that it's a dog. You probably have a fair idea what size of dog. You might even recognize the dog and be able to picture it ""in your mind's eye"".  But there's no dogginess in the noise itself. The noise is just a noise, a vibration in the air. The external noise and the operation of your ears causes dogginess to occur inside your mind. This process is known by psychologists as ""cognition"". It's the connection between what you're hearing and what's going on inside you.  It's no coincidence that the C in CBT stands for ""cognitive"". CBT depends on your cognition working properly, except in just one specific area. A CBT therapist relies on the 99% of your cognition that is working well to help you fix the 1% of your cognition that has gone wrong. That's why CBT only works for some mental disorders like depression, anxiety, PTSD, mild OCD, etc., which don't cause widespread disturbance in cognition. CBT depends on your cognition to create a reliable connection between external and internal.  If you have a disorder that interferes with cognition in a wider way, for example a psychotic disorder, then CBT doesn't work."

For example, a therapist asks an emotion provoking question, you become anxious because it brings up some trauma, your therapist might ask you how you have dealt with this anxiety in the past, if it worked, what do you think will work for you. That's exploring your own thoughts and ideas to come up with a coping mechanism that works for you."

In the meantime the new centre doesn't want to help as they think my needs are best met by the old centre (I've heard it all before). In fact the lady who talked to me sounded just like the therapist because she kept on agreeing with her.

She said that there was some doubt whether I would be able to see another therapist. She said that there were only 2 female therapists in my catchment area (I asked specifically to see a female for various reasons). All through the meeting, she seemed doubtful and pessimistic, completely different to how she had seemed before, and said that the reason I couldn't see the first, younger therapist (the one I got on well with), was because she was constrained by stricter boundaries, (or something along those lines). The older one (who I didn't get on with) has to deal with the administration side of things (because she is more qualified), and for that reason she has a little more flexibility to see people over a longer period of time. I said that I was willing to see the younger one for 10 sessions or so, even if I had to wait 6 months. Her reply to that was that it still might be very difficult because of the amount of time that I have already had with the older therapist. She kept apologising to me all the time. I kept telling her that the older therapist kept making me depressed, because she didn't seem to be on my side, and I'm sure that is the case. I think that the older therapist is still doing her best to block me from seeing anyone else, that is what she told me she would do after all. Two weeks on from the meeting I still haven't heard anything, so I have phoned them to say that I want to make a complaint in writing, I don't think it will do any good. It seems ridiculous. Ten sessions is all I want but they are making such a big fuss about it. I got on quite well with that younger one before, but the older therapist still wants to see me no matter what bad things I say about her, I have rung them up and said so many bad things about her, yet she still wants to be my 'one and only' therapist. What is the mental health system coming to I wonder? It's just as well I'm getting better over time, that is all I can really say If the older therapist has more time, surely she can take on some of the younger therapist's work so I can see that one for 10 more sessions? Has anyone her got any other ideas?"

As the older therapist is the root of the problem, it might be appropriate to make a complaint about her to the professional body that registers her as a psychotherapist. You could first write to the area manager to ask which professional body that is. Just putting that question in writing might make someone come up with a solution.  Once you have made a formal complaint to her professional body, it would certainly be inappropriate for you to see her for therapy. That might make someone come up with a solution.  Then there is the secondary problem that the area manager has failed to resolve the first problem.

Thankyou for your concern CBTish, I phoned the psch. services up and said that I wanted to make a formal complaint in writing, and it looks like they have come off the fence for now because I then had a letter from the area manager saying that they had put me in the waiting list to see the younger therapist (who I got on with ok), for between 5 and 10 sessions, along with a complain form. It's a start, so I phoned and said that I wont complain for now,- I never like to complain unless I feel it is completely necessary. I feel better about the situation now, I think that it was the threat of complaining which pushed things in the right direction for me. I'm still not completely happy because I would rather have more sessions, but at least it's a step in the right direction."

I go home back home to essex for a month in a week and the thought of it is MAKING ME SICK. I CAN'T STAND THE PLACE - IT MAKES ME ILL. My Mum is bipolar and an alcoholic, I don't speak to my dad (all he does is take coke and get drunk) - the only sane person, my nan, is now dead. The rest of my family? We don't speak - since my aunt ran off with my nan's money after she died. I don't need that.  To make it worse, I get exam results back in a few weeks which will tell me if I need to resit some uni exams or not - which I'm 90% sure I will.  To make it EVEN worse, I'm already £500 into my overdraft (fee free though because I'm a student), and have to pay out over £1300 next month for my new house in London. Yay debt. But at least I have a job lined up for the end of July when I'm back in London. That doesn't make me feel much better anyhow.  To make it evennnnnn worse, I've started smoking, and I've met a guy. Probably at the worst time of my life to meet someone - I DO NOT WANT EMOTIONS FOR ANYONE - OR ANYTHING - RIGHT NOW.  I've been on 45mg Mirtazapine for a while now, and up until now, I've been fine on this dose (I suffer from depression & anxiety. but before I was on this dose, I felt like shit even before life decided to throw as many stressors at me as possible.)

By learning to avoid common enemies of sleep and trying out a variety of healthy sleep-promoting techniques, you can discover your personal prescription to a good night’s rest.  The key, or secret, is to experiment. What works for some might not work as well for others. It’s important to find the sleep strategies that work best for you.  The first step to improving the quality of your rest is finding out how much sleep you need. How much sleep is enough? While sleep requirements vary slightly from person to person, most healthy adults need at least eight hours of sleep each night to function at their best.  How to sleep better tip 1: Keep a regular sleep schedule  Getting in sync with your body’s natural sleep-wake cycle—your circadian rhythm—is one of the most important strategies for achieving good sleep. If you keep a regular sleep schedule, going to bed and getting up at the same time each day, you will feel much more refreshed and energized than if you sleep the same number of hours at different times. This holds true even if you alter your sleep schedule by only an hour or two. Consistency is vitally important. • Set a regular bedtime. Go to bed at the same time every night. Choose a time when you normally feel tired, so that you don’t toss and turn. Try not to break this routine on weekends when it may be tempting to stay up late. If you want to change your bedtime, help your body adjust by making the change in small daily increments, such as 15 minutes earlier or later each day. • Wake up at the same time every day. If you’re getting enough sleep, you should wake up naturally without an alarm. If you need an alarm clock to wake up on time, you may need to set an earlier bedtime. As with your bedtime, try to maintain your regular wake-time even on weekends. • Nap to make up for lost sleep. If you need to make up for a few lost hours, opt for a daytime nap rather than sleeping late. This strategy allows you to pay off your sleep debt without disturbing your natural sleep-wake rhythm, which often backfires in insomnia and throws you off for days. • Be smart about napping. While taking a nap can be a great way to recharge, especially for older adults, it can make insomnia worse. If insomnia is a problem for you, consider eliminating napping. If you must nap, do it in the early afternoon, and limit it to thirty minutes. • Fight after-dinner drowsiness. If you find yourself getting sleepy way before your bedtime, get off the couch and do something mildly stimulating to avoid falling asleep, such as washing the dishes, calling a friend, or getting clothes ready for the next day. If you give in to the drowsiness, you may wake up later in the night and have trouble getting back to sleep.   Discovering your optimal sleep schedule  Find a period of time (a week or two should do) when you are free to experiment with different sleep and wake times. Go to bed at the same time every night and allow yourself to sleep until you wake up naturally. No alarm clocks! If you’re sleep deprived, it may take a few weeks to fully recover. But as you go to bed and get up at the same time, you’ll eventually land on the natural sleep schedule that works best for you.  Helpguide.org"

And I don't believe in that faith anymore. It's hard when you have a religious family. I wish I was born to atheists at this point"

I wouldn't be alive if it were not for the Catholic Church and the sacraments. In addition to being part of a community, I was particularly attracted by the centrality of Jesus in the religion - a person who suffers not just physically but psychologically. It gives me the strength to take up my own cross to use religious parlance and bear the difficulties of daily life. I don't know how I'd ever have faith or hope in life if it were not for the Gospel. It is what keeps my alive.  I know my experience is unique to me, but when I was an atheist or agnostic, I was never happy. The first time I experienced joy and peace was in the Catholic Church. Without prayer and sacraments, it would have been really easy to give up and die. Initially it was the thought of hell that kept me from suicide but now it is more the promise of everlasting life that helps me bear the trials and tribulations of daily life.  I also love the psalms from the Old Testament. If you haven't read them, you should. It is all about the cry of depressed souls to heaven, who cry out for justice. Theology says God permits suffering, he doesn't will it. Suffering cleans us of our attachments to things of this life. It is not always easy being a Christian. I have suffered a lot for it because I am the only Christian in my family. It has however been well worth all the struggle and pain."

I don't always 'feel' the presence of God. I believe in God - which is to say that I believe that he exists and he has created me for a purpose, even if there are times when it is hard to believe. I don't think God completely ignored or abandoned me during the worst days of my illness. If not, I wouldn't be here.  I prayed and cried out to God so that he delivers me from my mental illness. He might not have healed me but he did give me the courage to speak up, to seek medical help and a priest gave the sacrament for the sick and I although I wasn't miraculously healed, I was greatly touched by the priest's words and gestures, which to me pointed to the presence of God.  When I was an agnostic, I used to think of God as an old man in the sky. That is the wrong way to think about God. God makes his presence felt in subtler ways – he is present in the kind word of somebody who empathises with your depression, he is present when you feel good every odd day, and even in moments of darkness, he is present to prevent it from getting worse."

I have written enough for 10 books since that day  What do you mean by I've written enough for 10 books?  Thanks for your interest! Mine is a very unusual tale and I don't expect many people have experienced what I have experienced over 38 years - see the Schizophrenia section of this form for more of my book & various random thoughts from my journey through schizophrenia ...  Here's one of my many attempts to describe my awakening -  My initial awakening occurred in 1999 on a psychiatric ward. Let me tell you it was a huge shock because up until then I was a hard-core atheist. I firmly believed that anyone who is so pathetic that they need a crutch like religion just doesn't deserve to share this planet with me!  Those 7 days on Acacia ward were phenomenal. I felt effortlessly alert and totally euphoric and I seemed to have little or no need for food or sleep or ""entertainment"". This was literally beyond my wildest dreams and I was delighted that the rest of my life would be an absolute breeze.  I soon found out that effortless state was not going to last as my old anger and cynicism returned on a regular basis. I wondered what I had done ""wrong"" to be tortured by having a glimpse of bliss only to see it snatched away. The darkness was as bad as ever - or even worse because it was in total contrast to my euphoric experience!  Looking back now, it is a genuine miracle I never once ended up in prison or the grave during these infrequent but incredibly intense ""episodes"".  Over the 20 years since my initial awakening I have read countless self-help and spiritual books and visited countless websites in the quest for ""answers"". I have enough of my own writing & poetry to fill 10 books if I ever get it sorted & edited to my satisfaction. I keep writing new ""stuff"" rather than editing my old stuff. I am at my most alert at 3 or 4 am regularly but I try to be as mindful as possible no matter what I am doing. The poems simply ""pop"" into my head at all-hours of the day and night. Also some observations about the human predicament. Here's a taste -  ""People would treat each other FAR better if they felt genuinely joyful within themselves.""  ""Suffering can make you all bitter & twisted or it can make you more compassionate. I have certainly experienced BOTH ends of that spectrum within this particular lifetime.""  Now many of my questions have been answered - spiritual awakening is a process that takes you through many stages and some are very tough to deal with let me tell you! But that is what builds character & resilience after all.  Recently, I have found that in my more buoyant moods it makes very little difference what I do - I simply enjoy reading or meditating or listening to music or doing Yoga or chanting/singing spontaneously and I also write a lot and this page you are currently reading is only a fraction of it ... oh yes ... almost forgot - I also enjoy surfing in cyberspace - I seem to find something new or stimulating nearly every time I am online.  It still mystifies & perplexes me - some people are totally transformed by their adversity while many others become bitter & twisted and even violent. Half-the-time I don't really know what to make of my ""good fortune""!  A few more random thoughts - I have many notebooks full of them - including spontaneous chanting which for me is like an orgasm without sex.  The dark episodes are becoming much less frequent & less intense and I am learning to be able to remain mindful during them - so that is great news but not the complete ""cure"" that would give this story of mine a very neat & happy ending. I guess I will just have to be patient along with everyone else on this planet. Maybe we are all just slow learners! So far, only a tiny percentage of the human population have reached anything remotely resembling their full potential.  I am often extremely embarrassed to contemplate the fact that I belong to a species that indulges in something as absurd as warfare & violence. It can really do your head in!  If you have any other questions feel free to ask. Here is a poem I wrote about that experience on the psych ward -  I write this little poem as I sit I'm in Acacia ward until I split Surrounded by the maddest folk It is the sweetest, most ironic joke  I'm actually living in another world Where dreams and magic are unfurled The people in here have no greed or hate They all have learned the way to wait  Waiting for the coming of the sun Knowing they are truly all one We laugh along with all the staff My best mate thinks he's a giraffe  I gladly watch over these fragile souls Some think their minds are full of holes They cannot handle the jungle outside This is their refuge where they can hide  They hide not from themselves of course We are all connected to one pure source Our hearts and minds have merged with each other I call every one in here my soul-brother  If you want to join us, please feel free It really is the best place to be Surrounded by such understanding You'll find we are never ever demanding  You'll never know who you might meet If you take a walk down our secret street Please visit us if you get the chance We may even teach your soul to dance  I have written well over 200 poems since then ... yet had ZERO interest in reading or writing poetry before my awakening.  There are a couple of sites that describe awakening better than my puny efforts - just try searching for this phrase - spiritual awakening process crazy!  Wishing you all the very best  Cheers!"

At the end of the day, that's it, that's the whole debate. Believe in something for which there is no evidence if it makes you feel better and you value that more than the ""truth"". For people like me that's not an option, because going down that path (even if I could) would make me feel worse as it would mean betraying everything I stand for."

I can understand your reaction to religious dogma abt homosexuality etc.  Dogma is always driven by fear. Reality is far more subtle and mysterious to be contained in a bunch of dogmatic beliefs. Much of human history is the result of dogmatic thinking and conflict between differing dogmatic beliefs.  Dogma is so popular because having a truly open & questioning mind means there is nothing to cling onto and many people find that a scary & uncomfortable prospect.  Fortunately there is a better way than dogma and focusing on our differences.  I don't really get into whose beliefs are ""right"" and who is ""wrong"". I simply ask if you have a healthy attitude. A healthy attitude is one that helps make you a kinder & more compassionate human being. So by that criterion you could say many beliefs are not at all healthy on a personal and a global level.

I'm Muslim. Our religion wants us to seek refuge in him when things get turbulent. He did help. The concept of gratitude. When things get tough shaytaan (satan in english) wants you to think negative so you can give up hope. But if you do that he takes advantage of your thought process and emotions.  We believe this world is not paradise and wasn't supposed to be. It is a test. A test of righteousness or sin. This life has its comforts but everyone has a share of pain and blessings. We believe even the prophets were tested. As in they too went through difficulty.  I believe in Allah (God) because its obvious. The countless miracles the religion Islam demonstrates that cannot be explained as coming from human origin.  Here is one of those miracles. This is from the recorded words of Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) who lived roughly 1400 years ago (english translation of ancient Arabic so may not be 100% comparison from the original):  It was narrated on the authority of `Umar, (may Allah be pleased with him), who said:  While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), there appeared before us a man. He was dressed in extremely white clothes and had very black hair.  No traces of journeying were visible on him, and none of us knew him.  He sat down close by the Prophet (peace be upon him), rested his knees against the Prophet’s knees, laid his hands on his own thighs and said, ‘O Muhammad! Inform me about Islam.’  The Messenger of Allah said,  ‘Islam is that you should testify that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, that you should perform salah, pay the Zakah, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the House, if you are able to do so.’  The man said, ‘You have spoken truly.’  We were astonished at his questioning him (the Messenger) and telling him that he was right. He went on to say, ‘Inform me about iman.’  The Messenger of Allah answered,  ‘It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and in the Last Day, and in qadar (fate), both in its good and in its evil aspects.’  He said, ‘You have spoken truly.’  Then the man said, ‘Inform me about Ihsan.’  The Messenger of Allah answered, ‘It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He sees you.’  He asked, ‘Inform me about the Hour.’  The Messenger of Allah said, ‘About that, the one questioned knows no more than the questioner.’  So he said, ‘Well, inform me about the signs thereof.’  The Prophet replied, ‘They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings.’  Thereupon the man went off.  I waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, ‘O `Umar, do you know who that questioner was?’  I replied, ‘Allah and His Messenger know better.’  He said, ‘That was Jibril (the Angel Gabriel). He came to teach you your religion.’  -----------------------------------END-----------------------------------  Now look at these pictures:  Burj Khalifa (dubai):    Kingdom tower in 2021 (saudi arabia):   it is planned to be the first 1 km (3,281 ft) high building in human history  And there's probably more. By the way, the ""hour"" referred to above is about the end of the world. So according to Islam, the end of the world is near and the day of judgement is close.  I mention all this because you asked why I believe in God or a sign why I believe he exists."

I think the books were made to be taken literally eg in the book of Matthew it says the only unforgivable sins are blasphemy against the holy spirit or saying gods work is the work of the devil. So even if I wanted to become christian I would still be heading to hell because I have identified as atheist meaning I don't think theres a god which is blasphemy against the holy spirit so me like probably like a lot of born againers we're burning. Christians will tell you differently that if you accept christ as your saviour etc you will be forgiven but the bible says differently.  I also think the psychological aspect to it like adam eating the apple is a genius story and whoever wrote the religious texts must have been geniuses but also insane.  So I don't buy it. I see it as being self denial for comfort, we have innate drives based on survival which the concept of death which is mostly a human concept causes us to desire security about the after life and truth about existence so people buy it satisfy our needs as a species but still 0 evidence.  But the benefits of believing are there eg contentedness, peace of heart, sympathy, social happiness etc its that the concept is a paralogism the logic is there in the premiss ""god is our creator"" because people and old books say so etc so obey him but theres no logic in the conclusion being ""god is real""."

I have been an atheist for longer than I care to think about: I was probably agnostic for a few years. I was not raised in any kind of denomination, but I believed in God growing up. When the idea was presented to me that he could not exist, I had what was probably my first encounter with real existential dread. Now, it makes more sense to me that the world does not have or need a god. It makes more sense to me that the universe is a chaotic random event with no design or intention for humanity. That might change in the future, but for the moment I am firmly an atheist.  However, I will defend religion by saying that suffering is discussed often in most major religions. You might even say that the whole purpose of religion is to find some rationalization or relief from unjust suffering, even if historically it has often contributed to further suffering by those in power. I'm not a theosophist, but the Book of Job comes to mind as a parable about suffering from the Abrahamic religions. Buddhism sees desire as the source of all suffering; Gnosticism sees the universe as a false creation of the demiurge, but that's a whole other rabbit hole to go down. In short, religions have many arguments and lessons about the existence of suffering, many of which are helpful even to unbelievers."

I've struggled to fit in with atheists and believers alike.  I've met atheists who feel they have to be right and are close minded, putting me down for my beliefs like I am stupid or a horrible person for wanting to connect with a higher power.  On the opposite side of the coin, i have also met christians who are really not any better. If i question things in the bible, they seem to tell me Im yet again ""bad"" or going to hell, or somehow wrong about something if i disagree with them.  The reason that I do believe in God and bring these points up, is because in the end, the only thing that has helped me, is pushing out the negative. People are so highly into arguements, debates, and their own opinions these days, its just ridiculous. It is nothing but noise to tune out.  Spirituality is not about knowing all the answers, but about letting go of the painful lies and beliefs that drag us down. Its about realizing your self worth and connection to all that is. From a higher standpoint, seperation is a myth, and all life is precious.  I believe in a variety of different things: God is unconditional love, Jesus, holistic medicine like clearing chakras, and meditation and prayer to heal the soul. It gives me peace, hope, wisdom, and clarity. It can even be fun to think about spirit animals, crystal therapy, and gratitude for a beautiful world.  Because people are so lost nowadays, I think we could all benefit from believing in a loving caring being who wants us to rise to our full potential, and that we are worth it, mistakes, flaws, and all.  Spirituality is a journey, and my advice to you is to read and learn different things that resonate with you and bring you joy. I like how the bible says to be childlike to see the kingdom of God. To me, this is much betfer for my health and my life journey than just shrugging my shoulders and letting painful events defeat me, believing i have no purpose and that we are alone. And if im wrong, at least I made the best of my life.  Good luck to you"

When I go out it seems to get worse, and I find it hard to look at people because it's like they are all laughing at me. If someone upsets me, I'm pushed down even further. I find it hard to sleep. Does this ring any bells with anyone? The way I cope is to realise that the mood will lift eventually, even if it takes a couple of days, and try my best to carry on and do the things I need to and normally do. How do others cope? How do people find depression when they go out or mix with people? I know that there are no easy answers. From my experience, antidepressants only have limited success."

Is it the depression that is causing my social problems or the other way round? I can't help thinking sometimes that it could be the other way round. I see lots of people who always seem positive whatever life throws at them, and I think that being positive like that helps to make people feel positive towards them, which gives them a far better chance of success in life.

Five thousand words later, the characters are happy, everything in the world of the story is fine, and my mood is as happy(Or as accepting) as theirs ^^ This involves a lot of tears though, I've never tried self-harm - but, to me, this is how I get the pain ""out"" of my mind.

He has been increasingly low in mood, behaving erratically and drinking over the last 6 months. He has now been signed off work and (positive sign) now is accepting that he has depression but he doesn't seem to be at all motivated to help himself. He is unpredictable and difficult to talk to - he is also extremely difficult to challenge as he gets angry quickly. He's asking me what he should do about his career and life in general and as much as he agrees with what I suggest at the time I can tell he won't action anything. I don't live near him at the moment but am moving closer in a couple of months to help out but I feel like I am literally the only person that is trying to help - he's currently single, separated from my mum years ago and I'm part of a family that don't really communicate with one another. It's hard to go home/go back to work knowing he's carrying on as he is on his own but I feel helpless and completely at a loss as to what to do or if there is even anything I can do. It's starting to impact my own mental health I constantly feel sick, low and tired/demotivated. I went to a counselling session to try and deal with this (as know I need to be well to help my dad) and was advised to stop feeling so responsible and let whatever happens happen - which felt ok at the time but I just can't do that in real life/when I'm actually faced with what's happening. I don't actually know what I want to achieve by writing on here but I honestly don't know what else I can do or who I can speak to about this, so even some thoughts or similar experiences around this would be helpful.

It must feel overwhelming. In my opinion you really do need to take care of yourself. After all it's no good if you both get really ill. I havnt experienced the same and so I can only suggest what I may try to do and hope something helps. Others may come along with experiences similar to you and be able to suggest better. From what I can see, there is help out there for carers and I would take definite advantage of this, you need support. I noticed in my Dr surgery notices up regarding if you care for someone. So you could try contacting his and your Dr surgery see what may be on offer. I know with a lot of things it's what's on offer in the area you live in, some are better than others. I also noticed that CAB in my area advertise help for carers. So worth checking that out. Home | Mind, the mental health charity - help for mental health problems Mind may also have some advice if you telephone them. I personally would get any help I could. This forum is excellent!

2342,Depression Forum,421087,At a loss,2021-10-12T17:47:10+0100,author,True,107524,London,HarryFenwick,"As the title of the thread suggests, I have no idea where to start putting my feelings into words and this is a common theme. I have 1000s of thoughts and feelings racing through my brain but when I try to co-ordinate them and express them, it's like trying to hold water. For years I have been feeling a sense of hopelessness and detachment from the world. I feel as if my body is on autopilot and just runs on routine with no purpose, my emotions are either non existent or they are negative and I end up ruminating on my purpose. The mental exhaustion permeates into my physical being making me constantly lethargic and rooted to my bed until I realise I'm going to be late for work if I do not get up. I go to work and I feel like an anomaly and this applies in any social environment may that be friends or family. I don't feel like I belong and I am detached from all feelings. My rational mind is aware of what's going on but it is overridden by the depression which consumes any logic or rationale. I cry to myself once at least everyday from the accumulation of frustration, anger, emptiness and loneliness and feel like I am not deserving of love or care. I isolate myself by choice but deep down I wish someone would genuinely want to know what's going on with me and give me a hug. I haven't hugged my parents in years and have been ostracized by mother who never seemed to show any affection towards me. My value to my parents as their son was conditional upon how successful I was at work or academia but other than that, anything I did well was for my own benefit whereas anything I did that they deemed wrong was an indication of who I am. Even writing this is making me tear up because it brings these thoughts to a level of consciousness and it hurts. It hurts when someone asks me why I'm sad or depressed and I don't know what to say but deep down I wish I could express it and fix it. It hurts sitting in a room of people while I'm being eaten up everyday and not being able to be understood. The feeling of perpetual loneliness has been ever-consuming and I feel like I do not belong anywhere. I have a wife who doesn't understand what this is doing to me but the depression and anxiety to express myself produces a communicative block where I do not want to burden someone with my emotions especially someone who believes that they are just passing moments. Again, this continues to fuel the loneliness because now the one person I always hoped to confide in is not someone who I can share these thoughts with as her perspective on life is a lot more happy-go-lucky. One thing I've noticed is that when it hits me, I'm not able to talk at all and I just shut down but there are things I want to say and communicate but the embarrassment of feeling like I'm too emotional and the stigma of males in this society expressing themselves holds me back. Call it toxic masculinity, I call it societal conditioning. I live everyday in a perpetual haze, I work and get on with my day to day but it's more of a physical vessel moving that has no connection to the mental, they live separately. Not knowing if my thoughts are my own or if it's my depression is also a constant battle whereby I cannot even trust my own brain. Holding back the tears and emotions to appear 'normal' exhausts me mentally and emotionally but I still persevere everyday. I feel lost and alone. I just want a hug."

My parents did a pretty good job bringing me up even though my father worked abroad a lot and up to six months at a time so my mother but both my parents were old school sort of people sadly. I understand that Macho feeling as I am a male too and for me I did not cry at all because know one would believe a boy and then a man being depressed as we are supposed to be big and strong. It took me many years to learn that is takes a man to cry and it really is a strange one that as because I am now in charge of my emotions I can cry very easily."

However a few months ago, for no known reason my symptoms became apparent again- i was become more and more anxious in social situations and crying at anything one day then feeling absolutely nothing the next so would self harm to 'sort myself out' etc etc. My dr doubled my dose of citalopram but after 2 months it was clear I was getting worse and worse, ended up in hospital etc. My medication was changed to mirtazapine maybe 2 months ago... But even that was doubled after only a week. Am only just starting to feel some improvement. And after the citalopram 'stopped working' my confidence in a.ds has dropped, and I now wonder how long before these ones stop working and what then! HOWEVER... After only 6 weeks I really don't think you can make any judgement - you need to give them a really good chance. As I said they were great for me for a long time.

I've been on 45mg Mirtazapine for well over a year now. Generally speaking, my depression symptoms have improved a ton. I still have my days of feeling crappy - but I view that as part of this life-long illness, and I have my ways of coping, and these are MUCH less worse and at a less frequency as before. I've been on several different antidepressants now, and these meds have really helped me far more than any others!!!!  HOWEVER, I don't know if this is just me, but I barely experience sexual attraction anymore. I don't mean PURELY sexual, as I definitely feel that, but more romantic. I long for it. But I don't experience it. I really really really try, but no one does it for me. There's NOTHING I want more than to find a partner right now - BUT I JUST CAN'T?!?!  I don't know if this is even related to antidepressants but I have read that they do cause emotional blunting, but as a psychology student, I know this could be due to the depression itself. I was never like this before I started Mirtazapine, so it's making me think there is something up with these...  Anyone have any advice or thoughts? I don't want to stop taking them but I can't go my life feeling like I can't romantically connect with someone  P.S... Happy new year!"

In October my dad started acting strange, I noticed his car parked up in a seafront car park nearly every night when driving back from work. I rang him and he told me he was still at work. He was starting to get back home later and later and started going out on his own without my mum at weekends, saying he was helping mates decorating etc. I've never really been very close to him and we've always clashed, but I suppose he's still my dad. One day I decided to tell my mum about where ive seen his car, and she became obsessed, she was starting to take days off work to spy on him, it was all she ever talked about. She never saw anything but his empty car. Anyway this went on a few weeks. In November my mums dad was diognosed with terminal bowel cancer that spread to his lungs and all over they have given him anywhere from 6 months to a year. My mum was devastated and started spending a lot of time at my grandads house looking after him. My dad saw this as an oppertunuty to spend more time away from home hoping my mum wouldnt notice. I started following him, and saw him with another bloke getting out a different car. It broke me in two when I saw them kissing before they went their seperate ways I went in to shock, got some vodka and downed the lot, crawled home and never left the house for a week, trying to avoid my dad as much as poss. I didnt say anything to my mum to avoid upsetting her more. I wasnt going to approach my dad, he has one hell of a temper on him.  I dont have any friends, I really struggle to make friends and keep them. I just wanted to go crazy, stay away from the house and try to forget what i saw. I started chatting to a lad who used to go to my school on facebook, i didnt hang around with him at school. i met up with him and told him everything. he encouraged me to drink away my sorrows, i started going to his every night (I didnt really like him but it was a way of running away from it all)  we had a false smiles family christmas, i hated every minute of it. i just wanted to tell my mum what i saw, but couldnt bring myself.  i only really carried on going around to this lads house to escape my house. he had quite a temper, and when i started to spill my heart and have a rant, when he's had a few drinks he started to get angry, telling me to get a grip, he started hitting me.  just after christmas i found out i was pregnant, i was terrified. i seriously considering taking my own life, everything was getting on top of me and i had no where to turn. ive always been anti abortion, i felt like i got attached to this little thing inside me. but i knew a baby was the last thing i needed, and it was not with a person i even liked, never mind loved. but i talked myself into keeping it and felt like that was final. one day i woke up walked to local centre, and went through with it a week later. i dont know what i was thinking, my mind was a blur that week :'(  i spent early january walking around in a bubble, nothing felt real. my work went severly down hill and i could barely leave the house each morning.  i text my mum and told her what i'd seen, i couldnt carry it around with me any longer. she confronted my dad, has a mega argumnt, chucked him out (no one has seen him since) and has now basically moved into my grandads, she seems to be pretending it never happened and is concentraring all her thoughts on my grandad.  im in pieces. i went to my gp for the first time last thursday, i didnt go into any details (too hard to even talk about) ui wrote down my feelings and handed them to her. she said i am suffering severe depression and arranged for me to see a councellor, the waiting list is very long though. she also prescrivbed me 20mg of citraplam. i managed to take 4 tablets and they made me go mad. i couldnt stop shaking, i felt like i was having a heart attack and couldnt sleep. i havent taken anymore. i told her i had serious thoughts of ending it all which i do, she said she would arrnage for the crisis team to visit me at my house, i flipped, terrified of them, in case they take me to hospital. i told her to cancel and promised i wouldnt do anything, just to get rid of them.  i am due to see her next thursday, she signed me off work for 2 weeks and i seriously cant see me going back to work, but im scared in case she makes me go back.  i keep having serious thoughts of suicide, its the only though that makes me feel like i have a way out. it just seems right i havent left the house since thursday, im scared. i dont think i will be able to leave the house for my appointment this thursday.  my heads going to explode, i dont know what to do :'("

I think you have had to do so much on your own. Neither of your parents have been looking at you and your needs. That is not me attacking them, but it is true. I think I heard you right, did you say you had an abortion? If so, your hormones are really screwed up and that could well be adding to your depression.  I really don't think you should worry about the Crisis Team, there are no beds in mental health, so I am fairly confident they won't admit you easily. I normally talk on the bipolar forum, but depression is depression. I had the Crisis Team for months and I was in a suicidal depression. They really helped me by giving me time to talk about all my stresses and prioritise what needed attention and what did not. Not once did they admit me, even after an OD.  I think you are quite young? Did you go back to your GP to say the citalopram has had negative effects? It is important because these pills are known for affecting younger people badly. You do need support quite a lot, and I would suggest you accept the Crisis Team. They can meet you in a mutually safe place for you, they don't have to come to your house. You will not be the only person who has trouble meeting them at home.  You are taking far too much responsibility on your shoulders, for your mum, to initially protect your dad, minimising that you were battered by that man, having an abortion alone. You need help honey and try not to be frightened by the help. See your GP again, and, if you feel OK with this, ask if the Crisis Team can be reinstated and tell him/her that you need other antidepressants because of the reaction you had to your last ones.  You need help and I think you must take a deep breath and accept the help on offer. Your needs are important as everyone else's. I feel, but could be wrong, that you are not used to people listening to you. You are worth a lot and need to know you are important too.  All my sympathies and warmth."

It is fine to explain that you are acting this way because you so badly need a break from what is going on inside. Taking all your meds at once may not appear to have much effect, but you may be doing damage to your liver and kidneys that do not show up immediately. People tend to think that if they are upright and functional they are okay - this is not always the case.

I agree with BP above... it would be helpful for you to get assessed and get a diagnosis of what you are feeling. Knowing and getting a name for all the feelings and emotions that are going on inside of you can help determine how to battle them. So see your GP, or a good therapist. And be honest with them, really.  Next... by 20 years old you're only supposed to have accomplished knowing how to read and write, to do basic maths, know some geography, ideally know how to drive, and what I consider important...how to be kind to other people. Anything else can wait and will come later. All the stuff you probably see on social media is 50% fake if not more, so discount everything you see, or even better, just don't look. Get off Instagram and Twitter completely. It benefits no one except those companies. Really.  And yes... some of us have recovered from depression, but it takes time and some effort. But I have realised that I could not do it alone. I.e. I needed meds and therapy to get me through it. Some people need just one of those... it really depends on the person. Its a bit like cancer - some people get better with radiotherapy, but some need chemo as well. So have a good talk with someone who is the closest to an expert that you can find.  Try to hang in there..."

By saying I should pity both sides of you, YOU are admitting your intrinsic value to me, a person who lives thousands of miles away and doesn't even know you.  I'm answering you because I feel that intrinsic value, even if you don't. In all the emptiness of the Universe, you are a fantastically improbable, wonderful, growing thing. The depression in your mind is real. The anger you feel at yourself - the nihilism - seems big and tough, but it's a mental bully, actually empty and weak.  I've been there. So many of us have. There's no shame in feeling as you do. When we deal with depression we learn that the nihilism is ultimately .... silly. Again, there's no shame in feeling that way but neither is there shame in acknowledging that you and the world might be something extraordinarily special. If you can learn not to pay the mental bully inside your head any mind (or at least less), then you'll see that value in life again.  Really.  Truly.

Currently living at home with my parents I’m 28 and searching for work following stints at well known finance firms, over the last couple of years I have left various positions due to depression caused by the way my parents treat me.  18 months ago I was in a successful job with a partner I wished to marry. Given my heritage as an Indian, parental approval and support tends to be needed for anything to move forward. My parents began to sabotage this relationship acting erratically and driving the girl and her parents away on multiple occasions until there was no coming back.  They constantly put me down, shout at me, verbally abuse me and use finances to control me. Their treatment of me caused me to have very dark moments as everything has come crashing down and leave my job; allowing them to exert more control over me using finances.  Currently I have an opportunity to relocate to Amsterdam and take up a new job.  My parents who have always voiced that they care for me and put me first have made me so miserable that it’s almost not worth living. Their words are simply not true they take out all their anger on me constantly, if I breathe, if i stay quiet, if I talk it offends them.  Now that I’ve secured the role after months of their taunts they now have ramped up the erratic abuse and behaviour to the stage where they are jepoardising this as well for me.  I feel like that have completely broken my spirit. In fact as I have been writing this they’ve come in and begun screaming at me and taking digs at me again and ridiculed my use of this forum. Suggested I should go to a doctor...irony is the issue is them. Every time I have something good going for me they sabotage it.  A part of me knows that to have any chance of escaping them without destroying my life I’ll have to endure the abuse and fighting and being ganged up on on multiple times a day to get my career back on track, but there are days I feel like being homeless and unemployed but free would be better than this hell."

Unfortunately now I’m bound financially I have to take all the taunts. I’m basically their puppet.  I’m convinced the only time they’re happy is if I sat at home depressed, not going out, not working and dependent on them to the extent I can’t talk without their say so. Click to expand...  Forgot to mention I work in Investment banking - because of the depression and leaving jobs I’ve all but destroyed my career in 18 months so in the midst of all of this I’ve done 200 plus interviews to get back on track and pretty much lost all my money in the process"

If you can, I would go ahead with the job opportunity and bide your time. I know it's really hard but rather than being confrontational and telling them that's your decision - maybe buy yourself some peace and parental courtship by just telling them you're undecided and thinking it all through. That way, they don't have a definite plan to oppose and they might be nicer to coerce you into staying with them. You can be resolute in your own mind - but they don't need to know that.  I have an extremely toxic parent. I learnt some time ago to tell her nothing about my life and never forewarn her of my plans or share my dreams. Without information, she has nothing to attack or destroy for me. I have just learnt to acquiesce, smile and keep things to myself.  If it's possible to stay out of their way as much as possible - and to be calm and inwardly unruffled by their provocation, I would hang in there and wait for your job in Holland. You said they seem happy if you're sat at home looking depressed...well, just sit at home quietly planning like a prisoner tunnelling out!  If they are making you desperately unhappy and things are unbearable then your mental health must come first. Only you know if you can cope for a finite period of time before you can leave with something to go to."

The next day I woke up with a splitting headache and took painkillers and coffee to try and get rid of it. I ended up having a alcoholic drink. On Wednesday I started to feel really depressed because of the withdrawal effects of the painkillers, etc. On Thursday I felt even worse and was nearly in tears in the morning, and said some nasty things about myself, to myself. Friday was better and I managed to hang some curtains I had recently bought. Today has started reasonably well. I just hope next week is better. I'm having quite a tough year, I don't know what has happened, things just seem to be going wrong this year. Can anyone realate?"

I was thinking about the possibilities of suicide a couple days ago, I could not sleep properly and was worrying about my DLA coming to an end this year and being forced into work if I lose my chances of getting PIP which is highly likely and having to work for 7.50 an hour under extreme stress and anxiety with not being able to make ends meet and losing my flat which I've worked so hard on over the years and have spent a lot of money on it to turning it into a 1700's home. My life is gone by that point I don't want to spend the rest of my life miserable and suicide seems like a good choice as I'm just worthless to most in a nutshell.  It was only until somebody told me about a community in Spain who have struggled to survive in society that has people from all over the world who have built there own little houses on the mountains and have gardens to grow their food and they have running water and electricity from solar panels and a river near by to catch fish and stuff. They are also looking for more people to join there community.

I have no family and have brain damage. I can't function for long hours like the average person can as I need more sleep than the average person due to weak eye mussels. I'm a strong person despite my disabilities but if you suspect that there isn't much wrong with me for wanting to fight for survival then go ahead.  i think that your a good person.  i shouldn't judge / compare, & we're obviously dealing with very 'interesting times'.  i agree with supergreysmoke on this - what can be considered to be 'severe mental illness' / genuine 'madness' i think is rare, & psychiatry should have been kept well within it's remit, in truth the actual reasons for the explosion of it all i think is primarily social control / suppression, & it has Nothing to do with genuine healing anyway. That's Not to deny that people suffer & that life is hard, it's Not to deny all the problems of today's society, or difficulties that people have to deal with, i'm just saying imo it's Not stuff that should be primarily coming under psychiatry, & being labelled & drugged. People actually largely did OK before psychiatry & the pharmacological revolution, looking at a far broader picture of history. On aggregate far more damage & problems have been caused by the mass psychiatricization / mass drugging of biomedical psychiatry than solved (imo).  If it was down to me then we'd be living in a very healthy, thriving World of peace & abundance, with the focus on livingry, a Global leisure society. The vast majority of people don't now need to work. The economic system has been irrelevant for well over 100 years.  i can understand people having all kinds of problems in the current madness of this World / society & wanting a validation for it all. i can understand why a lot of things are the ways that they are, But it doesn't make it right, & it doesn't make biomedical psychiatry the best way of understanding & treating it all, it's Not in my view - 80% or more of everything coming under psychiatry would be far better dealt with in other ways. A lot of the masses are imo as much to blame as the system in all 'this'. The vast majority of people go along with it all. We can't as a society also turn the whole country into an open air psychiatric hospital, although in certain ways the UK does resemble more & more an open air lunatic Asylum / Low Grade Prison. Is it the direction that this society wants to go further along such a path with it all? Continually looking for example with America that is in many ways the most Fucked up place on the planet. We are going to end up with a situation that literally everyone is ill & on drugs.  Any person / group trying to speak out with any kind of actual truth & sense on everything, genuinely challenging the status quo, & wanting a genuinely far better & genuinely saner / healthier World & they get attacked, slandered, ignored, denied, ridiculed, marginalised etc."

I could not see life after 20. There was no life after 20. It was a strong certainty. I got to 20. The feeling was still there. Nothing happened in particular. I had been very happy. My late teens had been extremely positive and promising. I had no life project in mind, I did not have a vision, I never thought I'd live past 20. My 20th birthday was absolutely non-memorable. But somehow everything changed. Something died inside of me. I had found love, I had many friends, I was doing what I loved. But I was dead inside. I've been dead for nearly 8 years. Most of the time I am incapable of expressing true feelings and I have no empathy towards others. I spend my whole time trying to work out how I am supposed to act and react depending on the circumstances. I cannot be spontaneous. I come off as pretentious, self-righteous and full of shit. I feel like I am constantly putting on an act, only there is no real me underneath the mask. If you peel everything off, there's only a skeleton, and not a very strong one. I will not change. It just isn't possible. There is no one I can go to. I cannot conceive of going to speak to someone only to say, 'there's nothing wrong really, I just don't believe I should be here anymore'. Sometimes it feels sad, but most of the time it just feels right and freeing: it feels like this is the way it should be; I should be dead - or more precisely, not alive anymore. I am utterly disconnected from everything around me. My favourite past time is to sit and watch. I have no desire to take part. I know I have nothing to give, and I know it's not a bad thing, it's not a sad thing, it's just the way it is. I can see why life is worth living. But it is not for me. It is beyond me. Many people are good at it and they can make it beautiful. It is beautiful to watch. But you need something which cannnot be grown or bought: it is either inside of you, or it is not. I do not know how to free myself and stop this non-sense. I do not want to hurt, I do not want to change. I just want to be able to push the exit door. There is no one to help, so I can only continue to pretend: I'll get up, I'll eat, I'll talk, I'll laugh, I'll cry, I'll walk, I'll work, I'll drink, I'll sit, until one day my heart stops. I can see it all in front of me: it's already happened and it will be the same, forever again."

I've grown up with extremly anxious people around me and hiding it from other people is second nature; there was much that was not and would not be said. I go without sleep for days, and then I could sleep for a week. I am paranoid and always on guard. But it doesn't matter I guess. I can keep appearances. I am constantly depressed, even if I look ok on the outside. One word or the tone of a voice can throw me into a panic. I lie a lot, only to appear normal. Of course people can feel what's real, even if it's unconscious, and they instinctively know to keep away. I've only ever told one person about this. I don't think he really understands. I'm trying to write it, and even when doing this I still weigh up every word and try to predict every reaction. I understand I might be better off than others here; but I would never wish for anyone else to be the way I am and to have lived the situations I've been in. As much as I try, thinking that there are people worth off does not make me feel better. Because there are things going on inside which I can't control."

Knowing what you want to do is not essential, especially if you are only 16. I suppose the education system does mean that you specialise very early, but a good thing here is that you can find a way to do something else later. Employers will give you a chance. What is more important is to know who you are and to have meaningful relationships in your life. The rest will come afterwards. The will to live and the love for life come with knowing who you are (or wanting to search for it) and having meaningful persons around you who you can share this with. And if the rest is not a career, well it's not a bad thing. I'm no expert at all and I can't speak from experience, but it seems that there are many ways to happiness/fulfilment. Do you get enjoyment from your life? In what form? I know this might sound patronising or unreal to you, so I'll just speak for myself: when I was 16 I was not aware of what I was doing or how I was acting. It took a while. It was easy not to think too much at Uni (sounds weird but true). You might be scared because you don't know how it will be yet, but just know that once you're there, you'll be very busy trying out things so you won't have too much time to worry about what comes next (lots of people don't). You can always try and see; then you'll know. You need to give it time."

Click to expand...    Nightmares are a part of everyday life. They're always there. I once wrote one I had because it was so vivid that it left me crying for 10 mins when I woke up. But it doesn't help. I do not have an argument. I'm only describing because if I have to go on like this, I'm going to have to write it. Or else I'll just start screaming and I'll be taken where I don't want to go. I've never had help. I've never said this to anyone but one person. I do not know if I can get help. Although I dream about it everyday, I will never harm myself. I am a coward and my conscious self is very well trained and strong, like an automated machine. So I cannot ask for help from a physical person. I think if I said these things out loud, I would probably laugh them out and give myself a 'stop this nonsense' pat on the shoulder. Either that, or I'll collapse quickly and deeply. I can't have this happen. I've seen what happens next. It's worth than death. I know this lady, sort of a friend but I can't really call anyone that since I can never be sincere with anyone, she can sense something is not right and she's tried to have me talk. I always know what to say to stop her. And I feel a strange thing: it's as if I knew that if I spoke my mind, I wouldn't sound credible. It sounds crazy but that's how it is. Whenever I say the truth, something which I know is very different from the way others perceive me, I feel like it'll come off as if I'm lying. I am hypersensitive. Most of the time I am right about how people perceive me, what they are thinking (or feeling, consciously or not) and I can read between the lines. A tiny part of me always wants to say, ""no, it can't be, you are paranoid"", but most of the time, it turns out true. I'm highly self aware, but I cannot control some of my body language. And that's how I know that I'm full of crap and that I'm not simply being myself naturally. Because there are cracks and when they open, I could do something horrible."

Thank you for your journal. I have read some of it and I think you are very brave. And you have gone through terrible things. You seem to have a clear idea about what happened to you when you were young; I mean, you seem to understand how your mother really was and how much it's affected you. But I guess we can both agree that knowing does not help that much, for us anyway. What would help would be a path to a solution to overcome this 'knowledge', to link the things we know to the unciouscous stuff we do to ourselves, but that seems too much to ask from other human beings in the present world. Maybe in a 1000 years when humans are less occupied with 'things' and more with 'feelings'. I understand why I have nightmares. Most of the time there are very explicit. They might be very imaginative and symbolic, but I can mostly tell what they're about. But being aware does not help. I do not think that everyone puts on a mask. I think that most people truly appear as they are. At least they do when you've known them for a while. And I do believe that most humans can feel (not always know consciously, but feel) when someone has a mask on. But they choose to ignore it, and you can't blame them."

One thing which is important is are you really so uncomfortable with your life? Does this bother you a great deal? I think you should embrace yourself for who you are,even if there is noone under your pretence,your appereance or your soul.That is who you are.Maybe if you accept yourself for who you are,truly embrace yourself it will help."

The reason I stressed about having a purpose or not is because it does have some driving force over people to have a purpose.It may not make you happy but it may contribute to seeing yourself in a different way while you strive to achieve it..You may see or discover some parts of yourself which previously you could not see.  I agree with you there about to have a purpose first one needs to know himself or herself since from the desires of one'sself a purpose can emerge and can be fueled.I think from that point your purpose can be self-discovery.To see what lies benath you.Just my opinion but probably at some point of your life some incident happened,or some chain of events which caused your conscious to lock yourself in to such an extent that even to yourself.If you can find out what it is.. or solve that then you may start making progress.  It could be pretty hard to discover what that is and face it.Perphaps a hypnotizm method could be utilized provided that there is that sort of technique as help is available.I am no psychiatrist but what problem you have isn't just an ordinary clinical depression or any sort of other depression.It is most likely that there is a key incident which triggered this lock down process and if that is revealed and fixed you will be able to carry on with your life.(Anxiety and fear you describe portends that there is indeed something wrong had happened which effected you negatively a great deal)And discover your own interests,desires..discover who you truly are.It is a hard process for every single one of us knowing who truly we are because I believe eachone of us are a paradox.  You say you can not and don't want to embrace yourself as you are.This is understandable because the person you are right now is not the real you but perphaps a twisted version of who actual you should have been.(no offense intended) I think the key here is to recover your identity."

Knowing what you want to do is not essential, especially if you are only 16. I suppose the education system does mean that you specialise very early, but a good thing here is that you can find a way to do something else later. Employers will give you a chance. What is more important is to know who you are and to have meaningful relationships in your life. The rest will come afterwards. The will to live and the love for life come with knowing who you are (or wanting to search for it) and having meaningful persons around you who you can share this with. And if the rest is not a career, well it's not a bad thing. I'm no expert at all and I can't speak from experience, but it seems that there are many ways to happiness/fulfilment. Do you get enjoyment from your life? In what form? I know this might sound patronising or unreal to you, so I'll just speak for myself: when I was 16 I was not aware of what I was doing or how I was acting. It took a while. It was easy not to think too much at Uni (sounds weird but true). You might be scared because you don't know how it will be yet, but just know that once you're there, you'll be very busy trying out things so you won't have too much time to worry about what comes next (lots of people don't). You can always try and see; then you'll know. You need to give it time. Click to expand...  At school now, teachers basically force you to decide what future career you want and what you want to do at uni, as if uni is compulsory (and 6th form actually). I just feel like the only one who is worried about it all and I feel silly. I am terrified of change, perhaps more terrified of the prospect of change than the change itself."

I have it on my feet, my neck, my chest, my stomach, my back, my chin, sideburns, arms and bottom and it’s very dark and course.  This only appeared about 2 years ago and is getting worse and worse. I’ve managed to keep a lid on how depressed it makes me but it’s always there. Recently though I just can’t take it anymore. I’m 26 years old and never been in a relationship because I’m so embarrassed by the hair and can’t stand the thought of getting intimate with someone.  It makes me suicidal and I can’t stop crying about it. I feel disgusting and ugly and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried waxing, plucking and hair removal creams but it doesn’t work. Laser hair removal is way to expensive for me so that’s not even an option. Also from where I try to get rid of the hair I’ve made my skin dry, red and sore which just makes me feel uglier.  My doctor has ruled out PCOS and I’ve had blood tests that say my hormone levels are normal so my GP is also at a loss.  Please can someone give me some advice or share their experience so I don’t feel so alone.  Sorry for the long post!"

Are you on medication or hormonal contraception?  I know how upsetting it can be, I have a problem with chin hairs which started with hormonal contraception and has got worse with the MH medication I've been on and I feel really insecure about it. I pluck them and hope no one notices. I feel nervous about posting this! But it's quite common.  Could you ask your doctor for a therapy referral to help you deal with how you feel? It could really help.  There's nothing to say that you won't find love just because of this, I don't shave my legs anymore and my boyfriend is totally on-board with this! You're more than just your physical appearance.  It's good you don't have PCOS - does it run in your family? Is there anyone who could give you advice?  Hair removal is a total hassle, and painful as well at times, but if it's really affecting you then it might be the best option. Shaving is a pain because you have to deal with the stubble the next day. If you can bear the pain, epilating does reduce the amount of hair that grows in over time - but it will make you swear / cry at times. Also ingrowing hairs are the main thing, like with waxing. Shame you can't afford laser but that would be a good option for the most stress causing areas.  Anyway, don't feel bad about yourself, we are all different - I am sure you will find someone who loves you just as you are."

I've tried so hard in life, I'm not looking for sympathy I hate that lol but I appreciate any kind comments.  Heres the bottom line I have no family other than my sister but shes gone away to the south of France for her xmas and I'm spending it alone but I wish I was born with a nice kind loving family, people don't wanna hang with me and I ain't got no luck in finding no partner to be happy which is the same each year and I know some folks might think thats because I'm ugly or something and maybe I am to an extent. I've been told I'm good looking but the only thing that holds me back is my disability which is my speech problem I sound like I'm dumb when I talk I've been told that a lot and folk talk to me like I'm 5 years old and awww I'm cute but to stupid, in other words and not relationship material but I ain't stupid its just the way I talk. Coming to think about it I don't blame the people who I have met on dates for not wanting me its understandable. It seems like I'm just going around in circles with people year in and year out and as I get older and the time passes I'm not going to look any younger either.  My plan for the year 2017 is to find a deaf girl maybe she might accept me besides I might just find the girl I want then if shes death. I'm also going to take a sign language course. My foster parents were never happy with me because of the way I spoke. They sent me to speech therapists and everything but it didn't work. I try but the problem is that when I talk, to me its sounds ok but to others its slow and damn right terrible enough to put anybody off me and I ain't just saying that or exaggerating. Thats the way it is.  Its gonna be a hard long journey for me in finding my one because of the let down with my speech.  Dating can be hard enough but dating with a disability can be impossible and soul destroying. I like transwoman as well I tried with them too and not because I thought that they'd be easier I don't think like that, thats not my heart. I like them because I'm bisexual and find them hot as well as some women.  I'm a loser all because my evil mom gave me brain damage when I was 3 mouths old and dumped me in a hospital and left me for dead then I grew up in care. And it ain't because I grew up in care why I'm messed up. I put that behind me but every time I'm always gonna be trash because of my disability and will have to try much harder to go that extra mile to find the one of my dreams."

We all tend to be our own worst critics however. I know you've had some bad experiences, and it sounds like you've had some negative feelings and thoughts reinforced by some shallow people you've met along the way, but that doesn't mean that they're right about you in any way ... it just means that they're shallow; unable to look past one simple thing for what will undoubtedly be a number of very special attributes. Don't let people like that get you down; you're worth a hundred of them. They'll end up unhappy even if they get exactly what they want; some people are just happy being unhappy.  One thing that strikes me about you after reading only a handful of your posts in a very short space of time is that you have enough personality to fill a football stadium.

I get there and find that there are literally 30 guys at the urinals; all touching elbows ... 'Popular place' I think to myself. I go into the only spare cubicle ... only to find that when I shut the door there's a guy waiting behind it wearing an Anne Summers corset and nipple clamps. Nothing else. I look at him and he looks at me, then he casually says (as if he's not really that bothered)  'Ive still got the pork but I'm very convincing from behind'  I'm like completely gobsmacked and just utterly lost for words.

I deserve a really nice attractive women seeing that I get told I'm good looking myself in my pics by women, its like torture for me when I meet them thats it, first 2 mins they lose interest. Thats why I think with a deaf woman, I'd find somebody more suited for me because she wont be able to hear me and I'd feel like a million dollars being with her.  Well I decided to go online today to check out some deaf dating sites and all of them are paid sites I never found any free ones although most of them said they were free but wasn't. So I waisted my afternoon in google searching and signing up to deaf dating sites.  I think its very miss leading for dating sites to say they are free when they are not and hell, ain't no way I'm gonna be entering any card details online. I also think that its really bad for dating sites to make money out of disabled peoples misfortunes.  So I thought to myself I'd look up some sign language courses that I could do in London and that I'd probably meet somebody there in the process but the fees are like 600 to 800 pounds  Damn it... well so much for trying to plan my new year  Maybe there might be some affordable sign language courses for people on benefits?

I don’t have much contact with the rest of society except for work, pick up hay for cows, and occasional trip to the store for fear of being judged. I gave up a lot of leisure activities because I fear being judged by others and failing in the public forum. It’s hard when you don’t have anyone neutral to express your feelings and concerns to. I want to tell you that the folks on these forums will listen w/o judgement and help problem solve with you as needed. You can say anything here and someone can relate to and assist.

The obvious thing that comes to my mind are voids in development. A lack of self-assurance, not feeling competent which equates to not feeling confident. I think in our developing years there is also a lot of comparing ourselves to the way our parents treat us and then comparing our parents with how socially competent they are with others which builds our perceptions of where we fit in... Are good role models on the decline. There is the other factor of negative peer influences etc. and others opinions can be very cutting sending someone down a negative rabbit hole of self-criticism and destruction... It's easy to over-think other people's opinions, perhaps we should start with our own and work from and build upon our own strengths in our own way and in our own time. Rather than trying to conform to others expectations, build our own expectations make them realistic and manageable. Some late developers go on to far exceed the achievements of others who might stop short of reaching their full potential. Some late developers also build a much better understanding of others in the process and are able to make real contributions to life etc. through that process. Reading books etc. may be all good, but perhaps more important is a sense of direction and purpose to that. Hope this helps."

After putting up with the headache for about 4 hours, I had to drink a cup of tea which got rid of the headache but also lifted my mood again. I lay on the bed thinking that life was altogether pointless without tea or coffee to start the day with. Then on Saturday I woke up with a very slight headache so started drinking coffee and had altogether 5 caffeinated drinks including a coffee in Marks and Spencer’s. I'm having another go at it this morning. I will need to have a cup of tea if another headache develops but this time I hope it can only be the one. The worse thing is coping with the feeling that life is completely pointless and the depression which starts from day one. My aim is to find out if I prefer life without caffeine and to find out if it makes me feel better, but initially the withdrawal symptoms aren't easy to deal with. It will take about 2 weeks to complete my experimient if I can mannage it.  Caffeine Withdrawal Symptoms: Top Ten"

I wont be drinking anymore coffee today and hopefully wont wake up with a headache tomorrow. It's hard to see how I can enjoy life without regular caffeine fixes even though I have built up a tolerance. Maybe I will think differently in a few days time but I feel really fed up with life this morning, I'm sure its to do with the withdrawal effects."

If that is the case madmark then you live in the small room? It's funny but society sees caffeine as such an acceptable drug, compared to other drugs, yet it can create quite a lot of dependence to it, which can have quite distressing withdrawal symptoms. It's now my 6th day without caffeine, although I did drink 2 cups on Monday to get rid of a bad headache. I have a slight headache today, but I'm not going to drink coffee for it. To start with, all the time it was like my mind was craving it, I felt like I couldn't cope without it, I felt depressed, dull and lifeless, like a cloud was overhanging me all the time, I couldn't escape it unless I was asleep. Everything I did seemed pointless; that was after an average of 4 cups a day. Those feelings seem to have improved a good bit now, after 3 whole days without any caffeine at all. I've also noticed that my mind has started to feel clearer, sharper and calmer. Another thing I know that when you drink a lot of caffeine you need more and more to have the same effect. The problems associated with caffeine are not given a lot of publicity, but believe me they are still very real. I've got another week or so of abstaining before I decide if I'm better off without my morning cuppas."

Like you, I find it highly addictive, one of the problems for me is that the drug seems to go on doing something even after the caffeine has left the system which I also find addictive. I think that when you drink coffee etc you are more susceptible to headaches as well. That doesn't mean I'm telling everyone who drinks it to give it up, but maybe in your case you might need some counselling because the amount you are drinking might be making you ill. It really is much too much. They say 5 cups of coffee a day is to much let alone 40. I think between 3 and 4 is what most people have. I found it very hard to give it up that first couple of days and what has made things worse, now I'm not sleeping as well as I was before I gave it up, and I'm still getting that dark cloud that keeps coming over me. I bought a coffee machine recently and if I decide to give up all together I wont know what to do with it lol."

I was also getting a lot of headaches, especially on the days i was having less cups so I had to keep taking pain killers. I also noticed that caffeine wasn't really giving me a buzz anymore, it was just making me feel normal, I found I couldn't start my day without a cup. When I got headaches I often couldn't get rid of them with painkillers. Yes I'm using decaf coffee and tea at the moment, it's not the perfect substitute because they hardly contain any caffeine but it does remind you of the taste at least. It's best to cut down slowly if you want to avoid the migranes. I've noticed that you say in another thread that you will be having a doctors assessment soon, it might be an idea to mention the coffee drinking to him, in fact probably quite important. I drink alcohol but I don't seem to find it addictive, coffee seems to be the only one I get hooked on. Another problem I found was I couldn't resist going into coffee shops when I was out, and at £2.50 a time it's expensive, it was costing me over £10 a week because I simply couldn't resist going in to them and if I tried to resist, it would spoil my day, and I might end up confused and depressed. madmark, I hope that if you feel you have a problem with caffeine you manage to sort it out, remember, in your case if you want to cut down, do it nice and slowly."

I think in your case it would be a good idea to cut down, you don't need to necessarily cut it out altogether, but that idea of yours sounds quite good. Decaf works for me, I use pg decaf tea and kenco decaf coffee, the carte noir one also sounds quite good. You can also buy it for coffee machines. The main reason I've tried to cut it out altogether is because of the frequent headaches I get, and to see if it helps my depression, I'm just going to give it a few more weeks now that I've unhooked myself to try to work out whether I prefer life without caffeine or not or what. It's not such a big deal now because I've more or less unhooked myself from it, but maybe it will take a while to properly adjust. I've been noticing that my legs feel very tired, I'm wondering if that's anything to do with the withdrawal."

The good news is, after a week it becomes easy to function again. Its hard to know at this stage whether, for me, life is better without it or not actually.

The reason lots of people think it isn't is because it's so easy to become tolerant to it. Good luck, I hope you feel better soon.  ""You start to feel caffeine withdrawal very quickly, anywhere from 12 to 24 hours after your last use. That's a big part of why that first cup or can in the morning is so important—it's staving off the early effects of withdrawal. The reasons for the withdrawal are the same as with any substance dependency: your brain was used to operating one way with caffeine, and now it's suddenly working under completely different circumstances, but all those receptor changes are still in place. Headaches are the nearly universal effect of cutting off caffeine, but depression, fatigue, lethargy, irritability, nausea, and vomiting can be part of your cut-off, too, along with more specific issues, like eye muscle spasms. Generally, though, you'll be over it in around 10 days—again, depending on your own physiology and other factors."""

I'm not here to advocate that everyone comes off caffeine because if they do better with it then that's fine. I'm just saying that I'm sure people will feel weller for not being on this drug in the same way as they would by not drinking alcohol or any other unnecessary substance. That doesn't mean to say they will enjoy life more if they miss the buzz. I certainly feel better for not being on caffeine, but do I prefer it, at this stage it's hard to say.

I feel sharper and my sleep is better quality, but I felt rather depressed yesterday; that might be to do with the fact I tried one coffee on Tuesday to find it had 4 times the effect on me than it had when I was drinking regularly, so as yet I haven't finished the experiments.

2637,Depression Forum,135731,Just need to talk.,2016-05-11T14:46:34+0100,author,True,52941,London,BestNamed,"Well, it goes a little like this: I'm a second year university student, who for the last four years, has been aware that he suffers from clinical depression. When I first started to realise I suffered from depression, and it was completely out of my control, the feelings in my head, the suicidal thoughts, and my grades begun to slip; and of course I was unable to go to university. Fortunately, I managed to get into one eventually, and put so much effort into my first year. There were many times when I felt low, but I made sure to keep a diary to track my feelings, and my first year went really well.  Anyway, so I'm in my second year now, and since the end of November in 2015, I got to know this girl, we spoke a lot, and of course over time things got really personal and we jokingly flirted with each other and got clingy, and eventually after stuff happened, we told each other we 'liked' each other. I had also told her about my depression, and she told me she admired my honesty. A month ago, she decided to get cold with me, and eventually stopped bothering to talk to me (we went from talking every day, and she'd always bother me in the sweetest way). Honestly, I really developed strong feelings for her, and thought she had too. Part of me thinks maybe my honesty was too intense for her, and perhaps it turned her off; but the fact she knew this about me, and decided to just ignore me, rather than talking her feelings through, made me feel betrayed. It's funny, because it had only really been four months since we had started talking, but it felt like forever. And yes I know, I'm one of the hundreds and thousands of men who experience this, and women likewise.  It's just that, at the same time I've been juggling all this university work whilst putting effort into keeping her company and making her happy. My work has suffered, but at the time it was okay, because the blindfold of being 'in love' made it acceptable. For the last month, now that I've had to return to the ordinary world, I've been trying my hardest to focus on university work, but I feel breathless, and the butterflies in my stomach just make me want to spill my guts out. I'm losing a lot of interest in all the effort I've put into my work so far, and my depression is just growing stronger.  So, I decided to do what was best, and just ignore her, and try to remove contact with her, and for a while it worked well. But I keep having these dreams of her recently, and I wake up in the morning feeling so damn depressed every now and then, and I don't have any motivation to work. I feel my depression has intensified this, and now I'm anxious that this girl is going to make me ruin my second year, and the mediocre results will raise my depression even more. I'm trying my hardest, I really am, and I'm passionate about my subject (biochemistry), but none of this is helping. There was a time I just wanted to kill myself. And whilst I've moved on from the time in my life when these thoughts were very strong, the fact I'm thinking about it again just maky life feel like it's going nowhere again. But I'm well aware now after all this time, that this is what it means to suffer from clinical depression.  Anyway, in case that was too long to read, then in short, I feel like university life, and the thoughts of this girl who stopped contacting me, is just weighing down on me, and it's all just fucking pressuring me. And I really just need time to heal, but even if these exams don't go well, I feel like the time for me to heal in summer will just involve me be anxious and depressed.  I really just need a few people here to talk to, that's all. I still write in my diary after all these years, and it does help."

M Click to expand...  Well no, it wasn't immediately after, but it's really just the anxious part of me which think it's the reason. But you're right, it's best not to overthink things and jump to conclusions. As usual, I tried contacting her several times; each of which she continued to show she didn't want to talk anymore. I said to myself that I wouldn't bother her after sometime, and and just left her to herself for a while. To my surprise, she didn't make any attempt to contact me; after which I decided to break the silence and just ask her how things were going on, to which she ignored me and didn't reply. At this point, the low feeling was very strong, and I messaged her again two days later, to which she didn't reply again. Of course I could see her Twitter feed, and her Facebook, and could see that she was still around and 'happy'. She hasn't bothered to make any contact with me since, and I've just been trying to accept the fact that she longer cares like she did before. I've avoided checking up on her social media over the last three weeks, because of course, doing that isn't healthy for me.  But yes, you're right, perhaps taking that action would be best for me : ) I do have lots of friends, but they do not know about my depression, and in actual fact, sometimes I prefer it that way since we can just be happy and they won't have to worry about me. I definitely do enjoy laughing and being with them, and it makes me feel a lot better of course, but then the feelings of pressure from work and her pull me back down. But of course, it's a struggle that I have to get through. I will consider speaking to a doctor, thank you!  Well, I think it's because I know what it's like to fail several times, that I don't want it to happen again, especially as my life turned around in my first year. However, I do know that I make it out alive even when I do mess up with my studies, and family is always extremely understanding and comforting. I guess whatever happens, I must accept it, like I've done before in the past. But yes, once again, I suppose you're right, it's really the fear and worry that's hurting me. Recently, in the last two weeks, I've tried my best to get back into my art, which has really soothed me, especially painting late into the night before bed, and this has been a great coping method, even if it eats a little into my studying time.  Anyway, I will hopefully love to fly off somewhere with my family this summer, and this is something we've been talking about a lot. I think this would free my mind, with some change of scenery! But thank you, I appreciate it!"

There is actually one friend who I do speak about my stress with, but he doesn't actually know I suffer from a condition, but if I were to ever open up to anyone, it would be him. So I think I'll always keep your advice, and people like him, in mind when I feel at my weakest!  I've already been trying my hardest to ignore, and the uncomfortable feeling I felt from the pain she caused me has definitely changed over the last few weeks. It was suffocating at first, but now it's easier for me to turn my head away from the thoughts (except obviously when I dream of talking to her, like I mentioned in my opening post). But slowly I'm healing, and I think once the exams are over, I'll have more time to look after myself and start talking to people more without any anxiety or depression!  Anyway, I'll start taking the load of my shoulders; thank you! And all the best to you with your condition! n_n"

We've broken up and got back together many times over the past five years. The pattern has been much the same. Communication dwindles on her side. We have a fight - verbal not physical - and then she cuts off all communication for months. I'm talking the absolute silent treatment. It's a long distance relationship, so there's no opportunity to just pop round, or to bump into one another, contrived or otherwise.  She told me in stages about her depression. The first major step was to leave her antidepressants where I would find them. The second, after three months of total silence, was to ring me out of the blue to tell me what she was going through wasn't my fault. Both those steps were in the past two years of a five year relationship, so the first three years, including break-ups, had some events and behaviours that I just couldn't fathom.  When I was left searching for answers as to why she had completely disappeared the first time round, it was put to me by more than one person that I may be involved with a sociopath and a narcissist. That the glorious honeymoon period was just to get me hooked, and all the cold treatment, including the silent treatment, was just to feed the narcissistic personality. Extremely hard to swallow, as the first year had been amazing, but a distinct possibility.  I am no expert, but there seemed to be too many examples of behaviour completely counter to what I understand sociopathic and narcissistic behaviour to be, and as you can imagine, I was desperate for the love of my life to not be someone who had set out with the sole intention of playing a huge game with me.  So when I started to research clinical depression, peri-menopausal depression, post-natal depression (particularly in highly successful women) - yes, I was on a Google rollercoaster like so may go on, I guess - I realised that looking back through the 'lens' of clinical depression, many of her behaviours made perfect sense. The notion of the narcissistic psychopath receded.  Right now we are in another of the long term silent treatment periods. I haven't heard a thing for six months. That's no replies to any forms of communication. Modern technology means I can see when things I send are read, but that doesn't mean they are not simply discarded or deleted.  So I guess my questions are, does anyone here who suffers with depression ever shut out their partner for months on end? Or would you, if they didn't share your home, or live locally (she lives 600 miles away)? Can a narcissist still suffer with clinical depression? Am I excusing unreasonable behaviour?  I'm not asking anyone to tell me whether I should move on (although by all means give it to me both barrels) as no one else knows the full story, but I'm happy to be there for her, but only if I'm not the only one who can't see I'm part of someone's twisted game."

I'm not sure why your gf is shutting you out so completely, or for such lengths of time. No one can diagnose her here, and like you said, we don't know the whole story. But in my opinion it does not sound like a very healthy relationship. I am trying to think of it from my husband's perspective, if I treated him that way, and I would never wish that on him or anyone. You deserve a relationship where both people are invested and working to stay together. It sounds like she is using the long distance relationship to pick you up/drop you whenever she wants, and that's unfair to you.  Just my two cents and may not be helpful. I usually try to stay out of relationship advice but felt I should reply since I encouraged supporting her earlier without knowing this part of it..."

I've just replied to your reply  You've pretty much just summed it up. She reappears when she wants to. Her mental health has noticeably deteriorated over the years. Each time she has come back the contact time has shortened - long weekends, down to weekends, down to one day and one night stays, down to just an evening together.  Part of me is finding it hard to walk away from someone I love who seems in so much emotional distress. The other part says I deserve so much more than what I'm getting. Not even so much as a 'hi' or a kiss by text.  I realise how 'doormat' this all must sound, so I am just about at the end of my search for someone who tells me that months of silent treatment is typical of a certain type of mental illness."

I go very withdrawn when I'm depressed, and yes it can be for six months. I still communicate about things that are necessary, and make an effort to communicate with my kids, but on the whole I'm quiet because I feel I have nothing to say. Or nothing that anyone would want to hear because my thoughts are too negative. I pretty much withdraw totally from everyone other than my husband (I withdraw from him too, but not totally). Is your girlfriend totally silent? Does she refuse to be drawn into talking about anything at all, or is it just that she doesn't want to talk about anything deeper than 'do you want a cup of tea'? Depression can make communication very difficult. Either it's too much effort, or your mind is blank, or you worry about saying the wrong things or being judged for what you say. Those are the sort of things that stop me communicating, and it can be very hard to make the effort, and believe that it's worth saying anything at all.  I don't believe silence is necessarily manipulative, it's not always the cold shoulder treatment, or passive aggressive or anything. It may have nothing to do with the other person and everything to do with the silent person's internal state. Is she silent with everybody? Does she know how her silence makes you feel? Do you think she wants to talk to you but finds it too difficult or doesn't know what to say? Maybe there are neutral topics of conversation, avoiding talk about feelings or emotions or other 'difficult' subjects, that she might find easier to begin with.  It's lovely that you want her to know that you're there for her, but it must be difficult for you if you are only met with silence. Click to expand...  But this was before I saw this thread and your other one which mention that you live 600 miles apart and literally don't hear a word from her, and only see each other when you can arrange it. This puts rather a different complexion on things (btw, it's best to start just one thread on a topic, otherwise this situation can arise where if someone only reads one of the threads then they don't have the full picture, plus multiple threads on the same topic can lead to confusion about where someone has put their reply if there are similar threads!).  I'd agree with what others have said here, she's not really being fair, and you are being asked/expected to put up with a lot. I think most people would have walked by now. Having said that, I've put non-live-in partners through the silent treatment for a few days at a time when I'm I've felt too depressed to communicate, but a few days is not the same as six months. If I was in your shoes I'd ask her straight whether she wants the relationship to continue. How can you know what she's feeling in the face of such prolongued silence? It's a bit much to expect you to keep hanging on waiting for her to surface again imo. You need to look after your own needs and mental health as well as caring for hers. Good luck."

Click to expand...  Thank you so much for both replies.  It makes sense not to start different threads. I thought I was trying to get answers to too many different questions to put them all in one thread, but what you've said makes perfect sense.  Yep, the six month bit is the killer. I've not really asked her any heavy questions. In fact, questions have been fairly thin on the ground for fear of making her feel worse. It's generally been messages of support, the odd gentle reminder about things off in the future - a wedding that we were due to go to, a holiday at Christmas - nothing too pushy, recognising that she is dealing with one day at a time. I need to be in her city for work in a couple of weeks, and that coincides with my birthday, so I asked whether she might want to meet for coffee, lunch or dinner, not necessarily on my birthday, but no response whatsoever. I get that I represent a whole emotional storm, but I know I'm kidding myself by excusing every behaviour under the sun.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not making light of mental illness, but I know the time has come to call time on this. I spoke with an mh charity, and though they caveated their comments with the fact that they couldn't begin to diagnose anyone without their being present, the idea of six months total silence was unusual, if not unheard of, apart from the odd case of undiagnosed/unmedicated Bipolar or BPD.  I guess in all of this I'm left trying to second guess everything. I don't know the full situation, and that is no basis for a relationship. She is feisty enough to tell me to get out of her life, but I don't think it's a wise conclusion to believe that she wants me in her life just because she hasn't told me she doesn't.  It's definitely time to move on. No one I've spoken with has suggested that my situation is in any way typical - the time lag, not the distance - and the scientist in me says I can't ignore what's staring me in the face any longer.  I'm not sure I'm even going to bother with an ultimatum. No reply to that is just more heartache for me. I think I'll just disappear. (From her life, not my own!)  Thank you to everybody who replied to me.  Good luck with your own fight x"

Also as she says, different ones affect different people in different ways, so just because someone here says one was good or bad for them, doesn't mean you'll be affected in the same way.  I took ONE seroxat and was sick as a dog... it was awful. So then i tried citalopram, which works quite well for me, and i tolerate it quite well (in terms of side effects), but it only works for so long, and then the effect is pretty much nothing. Venlafaxine was also quite good, but i couldn't tolerate the side effects so i stopped it. What worked best for me was a citalopram / venalfaxine combination, which i did sort of by accident, and my psych nearly had a fit about when i told him, as they only use those two together for people who are really suicidal, and only for a short period of time. The combination can do bad things to your blood / heart, apparently, though i had no side effects from the two together. I was taking the two together for a couple of months, which was a Very Bad Thing To Do, apparently....."

My job can be demanding and long hours but nothing un-reasonable. I watch what I eat and I exercise regularly.

Sometimes I just start to cry when I am on my own and I can't find any joy in things I used to love.  I was just wondering if I am feeling this way because it is just me or is there something that could be wrong with me mentally?

It seems that modern life can be a very isolating experience for a lot of people and that you will not be alone in what you are going through.  Situations are often more complex than they appear and generally the root cause of our problems is a lack of clear understanding of how our minds work and a lack of attention to what kinds of thoughts we are creating on a daily basis towards ourselves, towards others and towards our own life.  I think clear and open and honest communication is always a good starting point... with yourself (you could try writing down your thoughts and feelings) and with the people around you. Are you able to talk openly with your girlfriend? Sometimes talking to those closest to us is the hardest thing to do when we are in the middle of something. In this case it may be good to explore counselling or other connections you may have to talk about what is going on with someone who is detached from your immediate environment.  When we do get to spend time alone it can be hard because you have to face up to the 'reality' of what is going on in your life and in your thinking. We generally are good at distracting ourselves from sitting with ourselves, yet this seems only to mask the problems we have and undermine our self-esteem. Don't be afraid of silence and being with yourself when you have the time... but perhaps also have a focus such as something inspiring to read, relaxing music, or if you have a hobby such as a musical instrument that could also be good.  I benefit a lot from meditation but if you are very agitated I would be cautious about diving into this straight away. However, silence can be very healing and a basis for creating an 'inner space' that you can keep returning to.  One thing that might help is to focus on and even write down each day what is good in that day (however small) and build on that. Focus on what you appreciate in yourself and others and what you are grateful for. This can probably help cut out the tendency to over-analyse and think in repetitive circles.  Asking questions can also help encourage in-sights... such as... 'what is it you feel you need to let go of?' 'what makes you feel full and fulfilled? or what used to make you feel full and joyful?'  If you are experiencing suicidal feelings though I do recommend you talk to your GP and at the very least let them know what you are going through. And also Samaritans are good if you are feeling really low and need someone on the other end of a phone.  Perhaps things are not as bad as they seem and you need to take some small steps to work things out. Don't be afraid to reach out for help or to trust the people around you. It is good that you exercise and are eating well. Sometimes herbal tablets can help you sleep more deeply, and avoid caffeine as much as possible.  Hope this helps"

I think what you are describing sounds like depression - but of course I can't diagnose on a forum. I always think that we should start to manage the actual distress first and then go into the reasons for it. Its like don't try to teach a drowning man how to swim, throw the life ring out first.  I would suggest you go to the doc and see what can be suggested. You don't have to just walk out with a prescription, you can ask for much more than that. Most people don't realise that they don't have to just have pills. Counselling should be available in all surgeries now, since the government made it a rule. But I would suggest you go privately and that way you can choose the one you want, and go as long as you need. It shouldn't be more than £35 an hour, which is manageable usually.  I think its about looking at your lifestyle, your needs and what you truly want out of your life. Working so hard can be a way for people to try to avoid what is emotionally going on inside. I know I used to do that. If only I worked endlessly, I wouldn't have to face up to a lot of truths in my life (my husband was alcoholic - a nice one, but still...). So if you go privately make sure they have ~BAC or BACAP after their names. [BAC= British Association of Counsellors and BACAP is Brit Assoc of Counsellors and psychotherapists]."

The list is getting so long I couldn't possibly go to a G.P with any of these issues and realistically expect help. Over the years this has lead me to just feeling totally and utterly helpless with my situation to the point where some days i wake up I just don't know how i'm going to find the will to carry on. Most days the pain is a 6/7 out of 10 and I just don't see how its ever going to get better unless I can change careers.  Most days I just feel like a total and utter loser. I have tried to improve my situation being trying to improve my health (seeing a physio for the MSK issues) trying to eat better, lose weight, exercise etc to absolutely no avail. I also have a heart defect that I've had since age 18 that seems to be worsening and the medication produces several unwanted side effects. I haven't gone to my G.P about my mental health as i just don't believe there's anything they can realistically do to help. I don't talk to my girlfriend again because i don't believe it will help and will just strain our relationship, she is however truly the best and deserves far better than me.  I have tried endlessly to apply for new jobs in new careers but like many other people have gotten absolutely no where when trying to career change. I'm dyslexic and dyspraxic and believe a lot of the time I'm being discriminated and not being offered interviews on this basis, or that my applications are just that weak that I get nowhere. In either case its pushing me further to the edge with every rejection I get and then they never provide feedback so you cant even learn what it is you're doing wrong to try and improve and do better.  Over the last year in particular like so many of us the pandemic has made none of this better and has only made me feel increasingly hopeless. I have zero motivation for anything and even just getting up out of bed is a monumental task. I feel totally trapped and useless sometimes to the point where i think about the situation and just start hyperventilating because I know i just can't stop working. I've thought about suicide numerous times and the only thing that shakes me off that thought is what it would do to those around me. Like so many I do not want to die, I just want things to change.  My mood is constantly low and I fake being happy and smile around my Girlfriend so that I don't upset her or make her day as despondent and despairing as my own. I try to focus on the happy moments and positive aspects of my day but these are fleeting.  I'm sorry for the tone of this passage. I'm just struggling to see the positives in life with all the things that are weighing me down, its not meant to be a moan or self pity but just an accurate depiction of what i'm feeling. I've never aired these thoughts out loud for anyone to see before, I guess this is a common statistic amongst men. I'd like to here other peoples experiences and thoughts so we can empathize and try to help each other through desperate times to prevent permanent actions against temporary problems no matter how grave.  Best wishes  John"

This forum is a good place. People here care and listen and genuinely want you to get better. Hang out with us and talk.  I'm sorry you are going through such a tough time. I can relate to the chronic pain as I struggled with severe back pain (6-7 out of 10 every day) for almost 3 years. It was no fun and really messed with me. Six months of PT and yoga really helped. My pain is almost entirely gone. My depression didn't go away, but at least one piece of my puzzle is back in place. I would say don't give up on trying to get yourself healthy. You need to advocate for yourself. There just isn't another way. Keep talking with your physical therapist about how to get better and stronger. Do exercise that you enjoy (you won't do it if you don't enjoy it). And be patient. You might not see results in one month or even one year. Progress happens slowly over time. Do you have any hobbies you enjoy.  Lastly, you might try talking with a therapist. I know they are hard to get in touch with these days, but you will have to be persistent. Talk therapy can really help."

It is a very long time ago )) that I faced this problem and it was never that much of a problem for me in that my wife has always been incredibly understanding and supportive. So telling other people - who anyway didn't matter that much to me in comparison - was a lot easier. Nonetheless I still didn't fully 'come out' for many years.  I think everyone's situation is different. You say you are with some mental health professionals now - what sort of professionals? Could they give you some help in this area? It might even be that in certain situations it would be better for someone else to tell your parents.  One thing I will say is that the strain of keeping it secret must be having a bad effect - causing worry, anxiety. I think that even if there are a lot of problems it is well-worth tackling this.

I told my parents that I was suffering from depression and they knew about the different MH professionals I was seeing, but I never felt they ""got"" it. I thought they would make the link between the frequency of appointments and changes in meds and so on, and how serious it was, but they just thought I was lucky to living in an area that had such good MH provision. I was in hospital at the beginning of the year and so they were on a fairly speedy learning curve at that point. I've been home for a couple of months and I feel that it's getting harder again to be honest with them, because of that note of disappointment in their voices if I say I've had a rotten day. My OH has been great throughout but then he has seen what it has been like for me the most.  Anyway, I really like the Black dog books - they are done like a children's picture book and say in pictures and a few words what depression feels like.

My father, on the other hand always had difficulties of acceptance, it was bad enough for him dealing with my mother but when I developed problems too he just couldn't deal with it. He listened to me but couldn't offer the type of support which I needed and closed his mind to it all. He was very ready to say, 'pull yourself together'. When I had to give my job up because of mental health problems, it hit him very hard and in some respects almost finished him off. It is a difficult situation to be in and I feel for you.

To answer your question Nick, at the moment I am under guidance from a Psychiatrist who is trying to regulate my medication, as i've been skipping from one thing to another over resent months, due to either them not making any difference, making my depression/ anxity worse or having a terrible time with side effects. I'm not feeling great at the moment and work being at a particularly stressful time isn't helping the situation either.  In terms of speaking to my family, it's not that i want to 'tell the world' or make a big issue of my feelings or even that i'm looking for sympathay (because that really not my style), i'm just so tired of lying and having to justify why I have no energy and can't focus on tasks at times. Really I dont want my parents to think i'm being lazy or not bothered, but you know how it is when times get bad, its very difficult to concentrate and get things done.  And yes your right at times it does make me more anxious not having told them. I dont think either of them have much knowledge on MH, as I also didn't until I began to feel depressed, but hopefully its something they could understand.

The report from leading UK mental health charity the Mental Health Foundation, published in January this year, urged for mindfulness – a form of meditation based on Buddhist practices – to be widely available on prescription.  In 2004, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended mindfulness-based cognitive therapy courses for people who had experienced episodes of recurrent depression.  NICE reported that in two clinical trials mindfulness training halved the rate of relapse for people who experienced recurrent depression. In the first trial, 10 years ago, relapse rates were reduced from 66% to 37%, and in the second, in 2004, the reduction was from 78% to 36%. But, says the Mental Health Foundation report, only one in five GPs has access to a course to which to refer patients.  Mindfulness is described in the Mental Health Foundation report as ""a way of paying attention to the present moment by using meditation, yoga and breathing techniques"".  (From a report by Angela Hussain on the Psychminded website, 15 January 2010.)

Fluoxetine and Sertraline send me manic (I'm not diagnosed with bipolar though, but clinical depression), and 45mg Mirtazapine is the only thing that has helped lift my depression the last 6 months but has obviously pooped out on me. I had CBT in the past and found that really helpful for my anxiety, but not my depression. My depression doesn't seem to be affected by any external factors.  What other antidepressants could I try that won't risk sending me manic? I have an appointment at the end of the month so I can speak to my doctor then."

I find this page to be a good start to understand the basic types: types of antidepressants and their side effects  Don't despair, there are a few types and if you respond badly to one then others may still work fine. Just a note of warning, it can take a long time to find one that fits, (it rook me years). Some do not respond to medication.

2695,Depression Forum,250734,Triggers - rape and feeling worthless,2020-01-06T22:49:10+0000,author,True,85637,London uk,Just_survival,"This may be triggering if you yourself have suffered rape/sexual abuse. ———————————  So today I was watching the news and I saw the story of the guy who’s been spiking drinks and raping a load of men!!! it really triggered me! And that is from the most recent rape/abuse (not sure which to call it) that’s happened to me.  I was sexually abused as child a few times. I had unintentionally learnt a coping mechanism Which means I had (and still have) a repressed memory growing up into my teens and early 20s. I met my “first love”, who soon became my husband, soon became father of my Children and I was able to live a generally normal life without the trauma or emotional affects of abuse come in (happened very rarely).  After 10 years, we got divorced I was a little all over the place, I dated, not sure of what I wanted.  (I should add I’m currently 31, I met him at 16, married at 18 and divorced at 26/7, just to give you the idea of the lack of time I had to deal with the stuff or even learn myself)  Anyway at this time I Thought I should learn life outside of marriage and in my deepest vulnerability wanted to feel love - which very unhealthy and some probably took advantage. But adults both consenting, fine, it’s for my own lessons and reflection what to take away from that, which I really have. But during that time of dating, there were 2 men who I feel saw me as this pathetic timid person and thought they could do as they want. One physically tried to rape me very forcefully and then gave the excuse later that it was because he really liked me. And tried to after manipulate the situation to make it out as if I was making a big deal out of something that just was “one thing leading to another”, I clearly said no etc etc, I managed to fight him off - nonetheless it was still Horrible.  The second man, which for Me is the worse (and the one that related to the news story triggering me). He basically spiked my drink. I was out. Woke up absolutely naked and still have no memory. at the time I had no idea what had happened to me which is a similar case with many victims, he told me some lies that I took my own clothes off, and at the time I believed him and was so confused why I would do this. Then he showed me video clips of myself whilst i was naked and told me it’s ok because he didn’t get “those” bits in. He played as if he looked after me saying I drank too much (I didn’t)... what he said was inconsistent, and I didn’t really know him. But at the time I trusted what he said. It’s only after things connected and I realised what had happened and it made sense why he was behaving as he did when I woke etc. God knows what video recordings he has or where they may be! There’s just so many questions. Like when I left, my chest hurt like I was beaten. I just don’t know what happened.  It all just makes me feel like there’s some flaw in me that men see and abuse. Like am I that worthless. When I was a child these kind of men targetted me and manipulated the situation to make it seem as if I had no right to be upset and not go near them, telling family member “I don’t know what’s wrong with her”...I got married to a man who had no respect for me (while he never hurt me physically or sexually; he deceived me and manipulated the situaiton) to then after leave him and just be there waiting for these kinds of men that are attracted to me.  I don’t get it. It’s depressing. It’s sad. Because all I want is love. I’m just a kind and caring soul and all these things (there’s other stuff) are thrown my way and I think if I was a friend of me , I would feel so sorry for her. I still have to get up and be this strong person for my 3 children.. when sometimes It’s just me who needs the emotional work while I’m trying to teach my 3 people the best way to live. It’s hard, because I bury so much and then something triggering happens and then it’s either deep sadness or anger that sets alight.  I’m in between just hating who I am and just trying to run away and be different (easier said than done) and then just accepting myself, this is who I am and That I’m worth it and it’s just the right person hasn’t been along to appreciate it.  Ugh I get self destructive too, thinking maybe that’s all I am worth. Maybe I should revert to old habit and just date to feel loved for a bit even though I know there’s no connection or they’re not actually interested in “damaged goods”... you know having 3 children is like a curse.  So many emotions that broaden out into different aspects of my life through this trigger!!!  Sorry this post is long. I needed to let that out. I hope someone has had the patience to read through my painfully worded paragraphs of blurted feelings .  How do I cope with like a million and one set backs. Constantly at battle with something or the other ???"

I was raped myself, although wasn't drugged or had my drink spiked (at least I don't think so). Was living with a mate, we invited people over and had a few drinks/played Cards Against Humanity etc. Couple of our mates decided to stay the night, we didn't have enough rooms so one guy had to sleep on couch in lounge room. The other (David) I said could share the bed with me but I said purely sleep, no funny business (had recently broken up with my ex at time so wasn't ready for sex), he agreed. I dont know what was going on in his head but sometime during the night, he managed to strip me naked without waking me up (dunno how as I'm a light sleeper) and had already gone too far by the time I woke up.  I freaked out, told him no like 3 times before I was able to fully wake up & shove him off me. He tried to stop me but I ran out of the room, crying to the bathroom but kept quiet as I didn't wanna wake up rest of the house. I didn't sleep that night, stayed awake gaming to keep my mind busy and next morning, my mate Rob (my current partner now) knew I was off, he could tell I was upset bout something. I eventually told him bout it coz I couldn't hold it in anymore, he was my biggest support during that time and allowed me to cry as he held me coz he knew that's what I needed. David came back from work later that day and tried talking to me, i avoided him as much as I could so I asked Rob instead if he could sleep with me instead as I was too scared to be alone. He did and just held me all night, no sex or anything unless I consented that I was ready for it. After spending that night with him, we slowly grew closer together & eventually I felt ready to try sexual things again, he took it slow & stopped whenever I felt uncomfortable with shit.  Fast forward 5 years later, we're still together now and are much closer together. Talk to someone, I found I coped much better rather than trying to keep it all bottled up and not share how I was feeling. Take care of yourself first, get your mental health sorted before you do anything else. I didn't at the time and now I'm screwed after all that shit, I'm cautious of men I don't know and avoid them as I don't want to be hurt again. Sorry to rant bout this but I thought I'd share my experience with you as I know how you're feeling & its a struggle to fully get yourself back, plz feel free to msg me PM if you'd like to talk more x"

I'm trying to be better but part of me has accepted that this is something I will always have to deal with.  I have always struggled with *something* mentally, I'm still exploring diagnosis. I started self-harming when I was 6 years old (that was my earliest memory anyway). I didn;t understand what I was doing or tell anyone until I was 15. I attempted suicide a handful of times in my teens, had counselling on and off, now on medicaton which works wonders but I'm still not really stable.  The truth is there's nothing wrong with my life. I have minor health problems physically, I was bullied throughout school, I was a young carer to my mother and baby sister (5 years younger than me). I do have a couple of close friends and a brilliantly supportive boyfriend. I manage to hold down a job and my manger understands my issues and if I need a short break. I am 'functioning' at the moment but I hate myself so much.  Before I started taking medication I genuinely believed I was some disgusting monster, I used to hear voices, see scary things, I was in my own little world. Now I'm grounded in this world and I found that hard enough at first. I feel human and I have bursts of happiness and crazy mood swings, I appreciate my life and what God has given me, I just loathe myself.  Is there any way to feel better or is this feeling something I need to learn to live with?"

Often when we have such feelings we may not be sure of how they are caused but through therapy we can find solutions.

Self loathing is all consuming and although everything in your life is OK there is that part that is dragging you down.  Cbt will definitely help. Help you to see that you are not a monster.

I have tried many antipsychotics and olanzapine is the only one that gives me any kind of significant relief from symptoms. I am going to come off it in the next few weeks but don't know what they will suggest next. Thankfully I have a good psych who really listens to me.

I then find a break through that I can come out with my feelings and fantasy's with transgenders and that I could find my ideal trans woman I don't want a generic woman, transgender is what I like and thats my preference and thats what I'll always like. So I then pursue my dream of finding my ideal transgender and then I'm left feeling kicked in the teeth because it all comes down to money and stuff and I'm not into that I want a relationship that means something.

2750,Depression Forum,182250,Is It Possible To Return To Old Job Within The Same Company?,2018-06-11T18:57:44+0100,author,True,68648,"London, UK",My_Second_Chance,"Hi All  I have been working for a company for almost two years.  Within that timeframe. I was working as a Support Worker for 19 months in a Supported Housing setting. It was the best job I ever had. Great management. Great work experience. Great rapport with staff and client's.  But I guess with working career. It's only natural that after a while - you want to explore new experience and a new job up the ladder.  So in April this year. I left my job for a more Specialist role. This new role was working for a different department but under the same management.  Since leaving the role, they have been understaffed. Meaning extra shifts to needing cover.  I wanted to maintain the link I had between my old workplace. So since I left, I have been helping out with overtime. I have helped to cover emergency sick leave. I have emailed my old manager (who is in charge of rota) and volunteered if she needs help to cover shifts. I'll do it.  Two weeks ago, I worked over my hours of work that I shouldn't have done. I worked 58 hours one week and another 53 hours the following week. I bought it to my old manager's attention so she is aware. Someone previously told me it's against the law to work over 48 hours.  Even this to be the case. I wanted my old manager to be aware. But I don't want her to get into trouble. And I continued to offer to work over my hours as I am 100% committed to helping out my old project. My old project remains a very special place in my heart.  So since starting this new role. I have found it's not working for me. It doesn't motivate me. It's more paperwork based. You meet less with clients. Your meeting with client's perhapes on a once a month basis. Management bitch about previous employees and how they left. You spend too much time in the office. Our number of client's will be going up to 25 per colleague. This means - more paperwork and less interaction with clients. I just find it boring. I started to feel this way on the second week. I thought I'd give it time - as it's a new role and things could change.  Somehow it's been another four weeks. I am now at week 6 at my new role. I still feel the same emotions. I feel it's time to look for another job. I was even willing to work there for 6 months and then look into requesting or applying for my old job back.  Anyway, I found out today another colleague is leaving my old project next month. So they are desperate and struggling with shifts to be covered.  I thought this would be my perfect opportunity to request for my old job back.  So I have requested to meet with my old manager tomorrow for a catch up.  The only thing is - I'm scared she will decline my asking if I can come back? Since I only left 6 weeks ago. She might say it's not enough time. But I guess, with my correct reasoning - I'm hoping she will be grateful especially as she now needs cover for the extra vacant. I'm also hoping with my loyalty after I left will increase my chances with coming back.  Even if she can't transfer me back. I plan on applying for the role when it goes up.  Do you have any tips or advice on my meeting tomorrow and the correct reasons being diplomatic on why I want to return?  Cheers"

However, I think that if you had a good relationship with your old manager, then they may be sympathetic to a return. I would be honest with them about why you would like to return.  If you can move back than that is great. If you can't move, then perhaps see someone in Human Resources about the hours you are working? That is a lot of hours, and is not good for anyone's health. I think it sounds very stressful.  Here is an organisation which deals with workplace questions and can give free advice. You might find it helpful to speak to them if you are not in a trade union.

I thought I'd update you.  So I attended my catch up with my old manager. She greeted me and informed the team misses me. Although I haven't left as I have been doing extra overtime. She informed she is grateful. She highlighted on how much she knows that I love the project.  I sat down and I was open. I told her, that I don't find the job is the right place for me. I find it less interactive with client's. I miss my old job. She was incredibly understanding. Once we established my non wanting to continue with the current job. She began smiling and asking me on whether I wanted to come back? I assured that I came today to request for my old job back. Her face lit up.  I burst into tears with happiness. She began laughing. We talked about my possible start date. I assured I'd like to start asap. Where her face lit up even more.  She got excited and informed my previous Team Leader will be happy. She called her into the room and excitely announced welcome your new recruit. My old Team Leader began to smile. We all had a chat and a laugh.  Towards the end, my old manager focused her attention on when I return. They will focus on my self development. She talked about aiming for Team Leader. She gave me a hug before I left. I whispered, ""I'm finally coming home to my family"".  My old manager has informed my current management team. Although they feel sad that I am returning.  I;m just glad I took the risk. It really could have gone either way. I could have got ""nope you left us. Why should I help you?"" Instead I got their support and their welcome back.  The risk was worth taking."

I am 21 and have no social life... literarly I am working all the time the rest time I am studying ... and on top of that I don't even have enough time to spent on studying and my marks suffer.. and it is like cycle I can't go out of...I have no one to talk to as my friends from university are older than me 24 - 26 and they rely financially on their parents.. don't work and just study and go partying... they ca't understand that I am independent ever since I was 18 and even that I am dying to go clubbing or something I really can't afford it with bills to pay and being on call 24/7... I am so fed up that even if I sit in front of the computer on my day off as now I feel guilty as I need to clean, cook, study, do the washing.. ironing grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.... It just feels like it doesn't worth it and I want to give up as even my degree don't guarantee me better job... my job is extremely stressful as well... I love my job I am a care worker.. but doing domiciliary care in a day that I am out for 14 hours I get paid for 7... The money are sh*t and it takes my whole time... I got a job in a home for slightly better money hoping I will have more time but they still can't sort my references out and it's been 2 months now and I am thinking they just don't want me anymore and I am totally giving up... I am just so fed up...My boyfriend have only one day off that he spent golfing and all the housework lies on me on to of my job and academic work... I literary have no time to even sort my eyebrows and it takes 10 mins... I am getting really depressed and crying all the time it just feels like too much... and now another 3 weeks without a day off lie ahead....don't know what to do"

Of cos you're not a horrible person. What you are is a someone who is studying and working really, really hard, so much so that you're frazzled.  And when other people around you are chit-chatting about their leisure and pleasure pursuits, even though they don't mean anything by it, it will get you down somewhat.  And I have every respect for you, for standing on your own two feet since the age of 18. That takes some doing at any time, but most definitely in today's economy and society, as hard-nosed and busy as it is.  It years since I studied, and everything was so much easier then.  As for all the housework falling to you, I think your bf needs to pull his weight a bit there tbh. No way should it fall to one person. It should be shared out, especially as you study and work so hard.  It's really hard for people today. I'm not sure what the answer is, but I wish you well and hope things improve for you"

You don't have to spend your life this way, but it might mean sacrificing your security / home / boyfriend.

I was always reluctant to go to the doctors about my depression, as I was on some other medication that can cause depression, which they wouldnt have let me have if they knew about it.  Anyways went progressively into a dark patch like you, and thought enough is enough, i need to get something to help with this. Im glad I did as breaking down crying at the drop of a hat, and waking up feeling so low, not being able to get off to sleep at night, & getting seriously fed up at work....was not fun.  Im on citalopram and theyre not miracle workers but i dont feel like killing myself or giving up on life anymore. I am not jumping for joy, but i get i have never been an excitable person, without the help of narcotics.  Wouldnt mind trying something different, but studying for exams at the moment so dont really want to go through the side effect period again.  But dont be ashamed to give them a go, as they could be really beneficial to you, and you dont have to suffer in silence. Although you may associate depression with being weak, having experienced depression can make you a much stronger/resiliant person & you will be a wiser person when you come through it. People who havent been there just dont have an F'ing clue.  Good luck, & dont put it off too long if you are suffering. Dont worry about a trail, this is YOUR life! so you dont need to try & create an artificial 'happy as larry' one. The cracks always show eventually, so be brave and dont be ashamed of your feelings, and this patch you are experiencing right now.  xxxxxx"

I also have some sort of psychotic disorder so it's hard to say what was caused by that and what was caused by the isolation.  One big thing that had been a constant for me was intense fear that people were trying to hurt me or trying to force me to hurt myself. I'd constantly be looking out windows expecting to see somebody looking back. I'd run around my house frantically at the smallest noise, feeling 100% certain that my life was in immediate danger.  I went to the emergency room with suicidal thoughts on November 21st and ended up inpatient at a psych hospital until the 29th. This was my first contact with people outside of immediate family and doctors since July of 2011.  I didn't notice any change in my social interactions. The first two days of my hold I didn't really talk to anybody, but as soon as I opened up I found that I hadn't missed a step. I've always been a good conversationalist.  Ironically, leaving was actually much more difficult than the stay itself. I had been so used to being alone before my hold that I never realized how lonely I really was. Now I was alone again, but this time missing the great friendships that I had formed in the 8 days I was committed. I felt like everything had been ripped away from me. This has been getting better every day but I still have some rough days here and there. I went back to the clinic last Tuesday for a scheduled appointment and it was pretty heavy being back there. I was just a floor away from where I was kept during my hold and that was a tough pill to swallow.  I suppose it's different for everybody and really depends a lot on what the person's circumstances were prior to and following the extended period of isolation. If one had poor social skills and then isolated himself, I imagine he would have markedly worse social skills afterward. I imagine it would also be a rough transition without the proper support systems. I have medical professionals, medication, support groups and various coping methods I learned during my stay to help me every day. It would have been a lot different had I tried to re-enter society on my own.  The effect on family and friends can be profound. My parents visited me every day during my hold and we communicated via written note (since my delusions don't allow me to talk to them) and the emotional strain I had put on them throughout the years was very apparent. It's difficult for anybody when a loved one is going through something, but especially so in a case as extreme as mine."

Over the past year I finally had the courage to stand up for myself and leave the group, however, I am finding it extremely difficult to move on, I still feel so angry and bitter about it at times.  There were a lot of toxic episode in our group's history, pretty much beginning with them bullying me in school when I came out as bisexual. Over the years there was one person in the group that hurt me that I distanced myself from. I moved to another city a few years ago but stayed friends with the group. And then last year, my ""best friend"" in the group became very controlling and possessive, telling me I wasn't contributing enough in their group chat, not joining their lockdown Zooms enough and didnt' seem remotely happy when I fell in love with my partner. When I tried standing up for myself, she blamed it all on me and demanded an apology.  We went months without speaking, and then when it became clear I'd had enough, she sent me a very long message saying how upset she had been, how many people she had cried to about it and that she relied on me for her happiness and her mental health. I replied acknowledging how she felt, and I also made a few concessions in that I knew some of the things she had done - like unfollowing me and my family on all social media - was not out of malice. But I reiterated I was hurt, and still needed time and space on my own. She then accused me of gas-lighting her and then blocked me. When I read it, I was honestly shaking and felt terrible.  I am completely done and removed from the group now. But I am struggling to move on. I feel angry at them, and angry at myself for putting up with it for so long.

Do you want to talk about some things? I often consider suicide and I rarely leave the house. It can be difficult being in your own head I know! What has stopped you from doing it so far? I like tricking myself and saying one more day then usually I can hold off until I feel a little better until it comes around again. It's a constant battle for some and getting help can be a long and difficult process but posting on here is a good start.

I agree meditation is great for anxiety, have been trying to do it more more but I need to be in the right frame of mind for it to work. I do just sit and breathe sometimes but it's not enough. One of the reasons I'm holding on is because of the guilt I feel about leaving my cats and family behind. I've suffered since I was mid teens and now I'm 23.. finally reached out this year for help with doctors/mental health nurses but honestly just feels like it's getting worse, like the emotional pain. They tell me I'm doing all the right things like working a little bit, buying plants to fill the void lol (I don't have much room for anymore) it's got that bad that I'm relying on healing crystals to make me feel better. I'm challenging myself to go out and about by myself, just to the charity shops and garden centres in my small town. But yeah, I look at my cats and feel so sad thinking what would they do without me idk"

I was in a situation similar to yours last year when my anxiety and ocd bursted in my life.I was so unmotivated to do anything I couldnt get up to go to the bathroom or even feed myself as you mentioned before,feeling empty inside.Talking to a doctor is a good thing, I am very happy that you've done that. Visit your doctor regularly,tell him anything you feel,tell him in what state are you mentally and physically. I did that and he prescribed me antidepressants.They take a while to kick in( about a month or two) but the difference is huge.Plus if you already are on them and the one you are taking is not working you can talk to your doctor about switching from one antidepressant to another,because I've heard so many people that have tried 2 or 3 different medications before they've found the one that worked for them. Beside medications I would advise you to educate yourself as much as you can about anxiety and depression. If you want I can send you the links of some books that are scientifically proven to help you cope with anxiety and depression(or at least they helped me). Anyway dont give up.Life out there is waiting for you,for us all.Take my word on it because a year ago around this time I was in the same place as you.Felt hopeless,helpless,doomed,that nothing was going to change,but things change.Find a friend that you trust talk to him,watch a movie you like,listen to some music that makes you feel better.For me was talking to my mom.If you have anything you can talk to me here.

It really feels like you're stuck and there's no way out, but it's good to keep moving forward. It sounds cliche and everything, but if you deeply think about it, it's so true. When I was feeling deeply depressed, I surrounded myself with more depressing things to keep my mind on thoughts of suicide. But deep down inside, I wanted nothing to do with that kind of stuff. Just like how you want nothing to do with feeling depressed, and thinking about self harm. It's tough to go through these kind of stuff, but I always say it's possible.  Your life hasn't ended years ago. 30 is far from old, anyway. And besides, it doesn't matter how old or young you are. You always have a chance to grow in life and have fun with it.

I love animals I've got a collection lol some may consider some of them as zoo animals tho but I don't have any dangerous animals lol  I'm also into wood work I can build anything out of scrap wood and have made lots of nice things for my house, my support worker has been surprised of what I've made from old scrap wood as it looks like store bought furniture but in a way I don't like that he is surprised because I get the feeling that he thinks I'm to simple to be capable of making things like that.  I'm also into astronomy and planetary science. I love going out for walks, I enjoy nature and I love 1700's architecture and art work.  When ever I meet people they dismiss me I'm always over looked because of my disability which drives me nuts but then again if first impressions don't float there boat then nothing else about me will, so its off on the lonely sad journey for me."

I was on 30mg for about 6 months. To start with I was fairly ok on it but over the last few months some bad side effects set in and it made me feel very lethargic and unmotivated, just wanting to sit down or sleep, I was finding it hard to go about my normal daily tasks. I was feeling drowsy, wanting to nod off in front of the TV in the evening, and my legs felt a bit restless. I was also finding difficulty in enjoying life at all and finding it very difficult to get up in the morning; I had to force myself out of bed. I was also finding it hard to talk to people and conversation seemed such an effort to me. I was putting on weight as food seemed to have become irresistible to me. In the end I decided to come off them and by reducing them by 10mg per week, so for a week I was on 20mg then another week 10mg and now I've come off them altogether. I am starting to feel more motivated, and all of the other side effects I've mentioned are disappearing and I've lost ½ stone but I'm experiencing some shifting sounds in my ears, like a shifting whispering noise, very often, and some strange sensations in my brain as though it is shifting around a bit, I also feel a bit 'fuzzy' at times in my nervous system. I'm sure that these symptoms will disappear in time, but all I can say is that I feel so much better for being off the medication. Has anyone else had similar experiences with Citalopram?"

Not a single withdrawl effect.  Once i've gotten over the inital side effects when i start taking them again (couple of days of feeling v tired and a bit wobbly), i don't have any side effects either. When i was on a higher dose though, two hours after taking them - you could almost time it - it was like someone had flicked a switch, and all i wanted to do was sleep. It was awful!  I get restless legs anyway (whether i'm not meds or not) but i never noticed it worse with citalopram. Venlafaxine though, made my restless legs WAY worse."

It's as if he's taken her right to take me off it away. I was also prescribed Abilify by him which had much worse side effects than Citalopram. In fact I thought that once I had come off Abilify then I would be ok on Citalopram only, but it wasn't the case so I have taken myself off the drug. I have requested a different psychiatrist and that was granted, the GP doesn't know I'm off Citalopram yet but I'm sure if she knew how much better I was feeling without it she would understand. I suppose that different drugs effect people in different ways. I'm still getting the little zaps in my brain but I am pretty confident that they'll go away. I have a cold at the moment but I don't think it's to do with that although there is a chance I suppose. I wonder, do people have any really bad experiences with drugs and coming off them?"

I'm still getting the little zaps in my head, and they could be described as quiet whispering or brushing sounds and feelings like small fireworks going off in my head, shoulders as well as feeling my brain is moving at times, to be honest I would say they're actually fairly pleasant sensations, I think it's just a side effect of coming completely off the med after being on them for over 6 months, but the stuff ended up doing me no good really because I feel so much better without them, and I'm finding it much easier to get up in the morning, this has really been noticeable over the last couple of days. I can't say I ever had the shakes on them though, but seemed to get more and more depressed the longer I was on them which seems a bit ironic considering they're suppose to make depression better. I also drank alcohol with them but not large amounts, usually no more than one glass of wine."

I mean, I knew it hadn't left (the depression) but I had learnt to live with it. Before, I'd just watch a sad film to have a good cry and I'd be fine again. This time it's worse. It's worse than it's been before.  Note: I have been to the doctors several times, they have a section on their computers under my name saying ""Mental health history"", however, I have never been diagnosed with depression.  My life's been slowly spiraling for a while now. Everything was going fine. I found out I was pregnant in February (2011), the test said 2-3 weeks. I'd only been with my boyfriend for 7 months. I decided I was going to keep the baby. I hadn't known I was pregnant as I was still experiencing what I thought was a period. Throughout the time I was pregnant, I had a lot of bleeding. So I took a long time, but I eventually made the decision to have a termination. (When I say I made the decision, my mum told me I wasn't allowed to live under her roof a be pregnant, and I couldn't face the thought of being pregnant and homeless).  Obviously I regret the termination. Skip forward to October/November, my aunt died, and I broke up with my boyfriend.  I have this thing where I can't grieve. So everything just builds up and hits me at once. After doing a 17 day shift of 14-16 hour shifts, I collapsed. Had to take about 4 days off work but I still wasn't good when I went back in.  Skipping to this year, I've had a really bad bout of depression and practically lost my job, and I have a £4k loan to pay off and I'm going under.  I'm also having a hard time dealing with the termination, as it's just hit a year since it happened.  I've just lost everything that I used to know and I don't know what to do. Someone pulled the carpet out from under me and I'm completely lost. I have no one to talk to. (Hence why I came to this site)  Just wanted to put all that out there. It's relieving to say it to someone even if I don't know any of you.  Thanks for any responses."

You may be offered medication, but you might also discuss talking therapies. You have been through a traumatic experience, and it is not surprising that it has come back to haunt you a year later, especially given your trouble with grieving.  It sounds like you're having a hard time at work and financially. You will naturally want to keep your head above water. But, on a practical level, you have to preserve yourself. It might be worth popping down to your local CAB to have a chat about debt advice. They may be able to help you come to some arrangement with your creditors. That could take a lot of pressure off you.  Keep talking here too - if you feel like it.

When my nan died in 06, I had a good cry, but I didn't have a job or anything else to distract me, I didn't have an option but to grieve. But when my Aunt died last October, I was doing 50 hour weeks, over 5 6 or 7 days and then straight after the funeral, I did 17 days in a row just to stop thinking. Because I couldn't grieve the way I wanted to so I just had to focus on something else. At this time I did start heavily drinking and was rarely asleep. I'd stay awake for 2 days at a time and then when I eventually fell asleep it was for 2 hours then back doing a 15 hour shift all nighter following day 12 hour shift 3 hours sleep. Bad routine to fall into. That's why I fell so hard.  I feel bad talking about the termination. It was with my previous boyfriend, and I have a new one now and I don't like to bring it up because it gets annoying hearing about your partner's ex all the time.  I just don't know what to do at the moment. I really want a baby. I know it's just because it's been a year (Also doesn't help my Aunt who died's birthday is a day after my birthday, and the termination was 2 days before it - That's why it all hit me at once) & I also don't know if I want MY baby back, or if I just want to have a baby. Which then makes me feel even worse for two reasons. 1) Because my boyfriend doesn't want one until we've both got jobs and 2) Sometimes I don't care what he wants because I'm overcome with the need for a baby.  It's really screwing with me at the moment. I mean, I'm fighting this battle inside my head. I want a baby. I don't want to have sex. But I want a baby. So I have sex. Then I feel like crap.  Everything I do is a vicious circle and I'm tired. I'm tired of putting on a brave face and pretending like nothings wrong. I'm tired of feeling like crap. I'm tired of fighting."

My problem, is that I put others before myself. It's good to an extent but it's not good for me because I do it all the time. I never put myself first. Always everyone else. That's why, even if I'm depressed, if someone else has a problem I can temporarily switch off mine until they're okay.  I don't know why I didn't properly grieve this time. I guess it was bad timing. I broke up with my boyfriend like a month after my Aunt died, simply because he was not understanding at all. I felt like shit, so I wanted him to come over and comfort me but all he'd do was makes jokes. I didn't want to laugh, what I wanted was for us to be able to talk about what was going on and for me to have a cry. But he wouldn't, he couldn't stop being sarcastic long enough and I got fed up of it.  Foxjo, you said you can't understand why I've tried to be so strong for so long? I've had the stiff upper lip raising. I've been taught to put up and shut up, and for the most part I can. It also means though, that when I go, I go fast. I don't know. I just, I guess I have to be strong for other people. I hate the fact that I'm so caring and considerate to others.  Also on the baby thing - We spoke about it again today and he said when he's got a full time job and we're settled, he used this phrase, he'll ""give me one"", lol. I don't know, it didn't make me feel any better, but it did. Like obviously because I wan't one now, that doesn't help me, but just the fact that he said it, it was nice.  I don't know if I mentioned it in this post or another, but I showed him the message on the SH Forum ""How To Help People Who SH"", and when he came back to work we had a little talk about it. He's trying to understand. But that makes me feel better and worse. He's so amazing and it makes me feel horrible for being like this. He shouldn't have to put up with someone like me.  I'm not doing so well at the moment. I'm trying to distract myself. I don't know what to do. My boyfriends just gone to sleep, he wanted to sleep ages ago but he stayed up with me for a few hours talking but it didn't work and I'm still struggling."

I'm much better now, but like you, I've always put others first. I felt so selfish when I was bad with my eating and depression two years ago, because my husband's eldest brother had just died suddenly. We helped each other through it, though my husband tends to keep a lot to himself.  You have an amazing boyfriend by the sound of things hun and he obviously thinks a lot of you. He clearly sees beyond your problems and wants to do all he can to help and support you."

Basically I am a student in my last year of uni, 20 years old. Have not had the worst life in the world by far. But a very sticky divorce of parents, which has left me guilt tripped into having no relationship with my father (even though I would love for him to come to my wedding and graduation ect) Since being at uni, I have only fully realized the amount of control my mother has on me in my life and I don't know how to deal with it. She has been very mentally ill in the past, eg. tried to commit suicide with me in the car. But the most hurtful thing ever is she loves my sister so much more, and shows her amazing favoritism. She does not support me in anyway, she picks me apart, spends loads of money on herself and sis but nothing on me, constantly reminds me im like my father, blackmails me, but seems to play the goody all the time, and only my friends at uni see it! I just feel so hopeless, and have no idea how to deal with the situation. She is now mentally stable and has been for some time, works as a counsellor and is in a stable relationship. I was really just wondering if anyone has any tips, as I do not know if i can deal with this anymore. Please help, sorry to ramble!"

My previous symptoms were low mood, inability to concentrate, suicidal thoughts.  I'm now 4 days in and for the last two days have been suffering from massive panic attacks and anxiety. Having never suffered from panic attacks in the past this can really only be due to the Citalopram. I've read that the first week can be hellish but it can eventually be worth it...  Has anyone else had panic attacks when starting with this SSRI? Is this a sign that it just isn't working for me or just something that needs to be gotten through (very hard with it being Christmas with lots of people around).  Cheers, Tim"

Having done some reading it appears that yes Citalopram can cause anxiety attacks and mood swings but it's a really low percentage.  I'm kind of hoping for not the anxiety attacks and mood swings as I suffer with them enough.  The upside is that one of the side effects appears to be a cure for premature ejaculation!  I'd really reccomend contacting your doctor and let them know what you're experiencing as they may want to put you on something else. The point is to stop you feeling distressed I think.

I had one bad panic attack about six weeks after starting it, but to be honest I was not in a good place then.  What I have found, and it appears common, is an unquenchable thirst, you get light headed if you stand up too quick (it is to do with blood pressure) and also I sometimes wake up with a bloody/metallic taste in my mouth which I guess is linked to not taking liquid on board for sometime.  I was told that booze stops it from working. I have only drunk three times since I started taking it and two of the times, including last night, I struggled to sleep where as since I started it I found I have had no problem sleeping."

The GPs advice was that while it's not really advised it should be fine to drink.  I suspect I've been heavily self medicating on alcohol for quite a while, not to problem levels but it's rare for a day to go by without having anything to drink. I am planning to have a dry month for January and did consider not starting the Citalopram until then but things got a little too much over Christmas."

The skills you need in order to defeat panic and anxiety attacks are very tangible and available to you from your GP. It's very likely it will work for you although I know there are no guarantees.  Anxiety management classes are available in most large towns and they will help you defeat the panic attacks almost entirely. Once you understand their origins they become increasingly manageable. Almost to the point that it has been a long time since they have controlled me. I no longer have the sense of dying the majority of the time that I used to and that is because of the anxiety management course I took part in several years ago. For me - it was really like learning to ride a bike and I've never forgotten it.  The sense of relief in finding ways to defeat and overcome the panic and terror was a revelation to me as I honestly didn't see a way through it all.  I'm not saying my experience is the same as yours but I would strongly recommend anxiety management courses to anyone experiencing the horror of panic attacks on a regular basis.  There are times when the illness overrides those coping skills but I know I would struggle without them.  best wishes robert."

After a rocky week or two it then gets better, and will actually help anxiety symptoms before it helps with depression. It can work really well, providing you can get past the first stage, so do keep going if you possibly can."

The thing was I've never suffered from panic attacks at all in the past and so was very surprised when they suddenly overtook me after 3 or 4 days on the Citalopram.  After about 10 days most of the side effects had gone but I also seem to be back more or less in the mood I was before starting (I think the side effects distracted me which in effect made things seem better). I've read that it can take 2-4 weeks or even longer before the antidepressant really kicks in so I presume I need to stick with them for longer, but does anyone have a feel for how long it should be before I call it a day and say they're not for me?

I'd had to go off sick from work, so couldn't compare accurately how low I was with the beginning - the cause of my depression didn't come from work, but stopping work did at least take a pressure off me. I started to notice that I was feeling better at about six weeks, and it was a weird situation of having been better for a bit before I realised it. One startling thing is laughing again for the first time in months. From what I understand, they're unlikely to write a drug off before trying it for two months, and if it works a bit but not completely, then they might well increase a dose rather than changing it."

I have noticed my mood has been more all over the place than ever today, some real highs where I was wondering what all the fuss had been about followed 10 minutes later by complete lows and wondering if I could possibly carry on.  The other problem I've had is with sleeping, it was erratic before but I only seem to be getting 4 or 5 hours on the Citalopram where I'd at least get 6 or 7 some nights previously (and sometimes none...).

As I've got better, that has faded, and now only recurs when I'm really stressed.

I've gone to therapy (recently referred myself back) and have also tried different medications.  There are some material, tangible things that happened to me over the past couple years that were tough to go through, primarily a breakdown in a really unhealthy relationship. I've also dealt with some lingering trauma from the past.  I'm not sure if it's something else, or an mixture of those things, but recently I just feel so, so, so deflated and numb. I was off work last week because of how low I felt, and now I'm back this week and it's just coming back again..  I feel so detached from my life. I hate my job. Last year I had to walk away from some unhealthy friendships, which was the right thing to do, but as a result obviously my social circle is a lot smaller. I've also had some issues with my family and I'm feeling increasingly distant from them. I get that ""age is just a number"" etc, but I turn 30 in a few months and on a daily basis I'm asking myself ""Is this it? Is this really my life?"". I used to be such a hopeful, optimistic person like when I was young I was constantly pushing myself, applying myself in school and University etc, so excited to grow up and go off into the world and live my life. And now I'm like why did I bother? It's almost like I have felt crap for so long I'm starting to forget what it is like to be happy, or if that's even possible. The idea of living another 29 years, if it's going to be remotely like my life so far, is terrifying.  It just feels like there are so many downsides to ""real life"" that make me constantly question what the hell the point in any of it actually is. Worrying about money constantly. Feeling like a zombie on my commute to a job I couldn't care less about if I tried. Spending my whole week looking forward to the weekend and then the whole weekend dreading the next week. Barely having the energy to talk to people. Working so hard on a side-hustle so I can escape my job that I barely have time for myself. It's like I feel constantly stuck in a vicious cycle, catch 22.  In the past I've let people walk all over me. I'm trying hard to move on but I still sometimes feel almost constantly angry. Like last night, I had a horrible dream about a person who was really mean to me, and I woke up in a terrible mood and felt angry all over again.  I'm not sure exactly what I'm hoping to get from writing all this, I just really need help"

If I could, it would be fairly easy to a) reverse-engineer a situation that always has that and b) make sure I never lose it  I think it's something of emotional security.

I started feeling good after a few weeks, but this kept progressing eventually crashed into one weird state of hyperactivity/restlessness and depression, coupled with delusions, self harm, risky behavior etc (seemed reminiscent to a mixed stated in bipolar, but at the moment I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, however bipolar actually runs in my family so this was a bit of a red flag for me). I've had similar symptoms off medication but never to that extent.  So, my doctor switched me onto 50mg of Sertraline. I've been taking this for over a month now with literally no effect (except I'm feeling a little more moody). I saw my doctor the other day who said she'd like to leave it ANOTHER month until she changes the drug/increases my dose, as well as prescribing me 7.5mg zopiclone for insomnia (doesn't work as well as I hoped and it just leaves a horrible taste in my mouth!). She said she's only allowed to go up to 100mg and if that doesn't work she will have to refer me to a specialist or something.  Anyway. I feel feel awful. Completely empty is the only way to describe it. Nothing fills the hole I feel inside me no matter how hard I try. It's just pissed me off a bit as I start university this Friday. I want to be happy, but I know I'm going to be moping around feeling like crap and angry at everyone for no reason. I'll have to find another doctor up there and I'm scared they won't understand.  I'm not sure what happens next? I mean, what other treatment is there (already had CBT which also didn't work)? To be honest I even doubt my diagnosis or unipolar depression - it doesn't seem completely accurate in my case, but I thought I'd post in here as it's still my official diagnosis.  I just don't know what to do. I want to feel normal. I just get so depressed and I don't want to do anything or see anyone, then I just feel so irritable and angry and clingy with everyone around me.

I know it must be frustrating when they are not working and in the meantime you are still feeling crap.  It's not something i know much about as I've never taken them so hopefully someone else can advise you about that.  If you're feeling your diagnosis is incorrect then maybe seeing a specialist would be the best way forward, as if there's something else going on antidepressants may not be the best treatment for you.  I was wondering what you felt your diagnosis should be? the emptiness you describe could be part of feeling depressed but it's also something people with Borderline PD say they have, but i don't know you'd need to maybe look at the PD section of the forum and see if that was something you identified with. If bipolar runs in the family maybe seeing a specialist would be a better idea as antidepressants are contraindicated with bipolar.  There are other types of psychotherapy apart from CBT so if that didn't work don't give up, it's just harder to get them on the NHS."

I am currently on fluoxetine, been on them five weeks and my anxiety is worse, feel restless, have the shakes, but it should settle down in the next few weeks. I prefer fluoxetine to the others because out of all the others it's the one that helps with my depression and obsessive compulsive disorder the best, doesn't help with the anxiety that much, but two out of three isn't bad.  I think when it comes to antidepressents, it's finding the best one that suits you, with the least side effects. I didn't find that cbt helped either, it made me feel worse. I am that anxious when i go to cbt that i don't listen. I just want to get out of there as fast as possible. I have found reading about it is much better suited to me and helps more.  I would go back talk to your doctor if those don't work either, and maybe you can find one that does.

But now I'm really starting to notice how much the downsides of it affect me. I have this depression that goes round in cycles, always hitting at this time of year - coinciding nicely with the new school year (I'm a teaching assistant) when everything seems to change and my routine changes.  I'm so bored when I'm not at work, but I'm finding that really hard at the moment, too, and I can't settle to anything at home. I have this list of things I can do - contact old friends who are at uni, sort out my ucas form (I want to go to uni in September, too), do my share of the housework, reply to the letter someone sent me, play with the pets; but I can't find the motivation to do any of it. So I can't win.  I don't have many friends because all my relationships have to be quite intense; I only have two close friends - one who lives 80 miles away and one who lives round the corner who I see more often, but when she's busy I'm stuck on my own.

I think the friends I do have don't like me really, they just put up with the way I talk and talk and talk about myself and the way I'm so selfish because they are being kind. I don't know what they really think of me. I'm seeing my close friend who lives nearby later but I can't talk to her because she has depression and she has enough to put up with, and last time I felt down she wasn't supportive. (She was feeling really low herself at the time except I can't tell without her spelling it out for me - stupid AS - so I guess that's why and I've let her off the hook - but that just proves that we could be in the same position this time).

I can relate to the lack of motivation, feeling that everyone's had enough of you (although I'm sure that's not the case) and being affected by the start of the school year. I'm suffering from depression and am trying not to put too much pressure on myself to do too much and ignore the guilt that inevitably gnaws at me when I see the 'to do' list.

My managers have been checking in on me as well as giving me people to help with my workload even though there is still not enough people at my workplace to help with demand. Recently I was on a meeting where the head of a department was annoyed because I did not do enough work in his mind minus the fact he had not set an expectation of that he needed and they did not give not enough time for what he need. He practically berated me and stated that I wasted his time and everyone's time. Although I know I was not in the wrong, this sent me off the edge depression-wise. The fact I was doing all this work, constantly doing overtime and this person made me feel so small and so guilty about not doing what he wanted when he didn't state what he wanted. He even contacted the manager I was talking to for this project and the head of my department to state how annoyed and disappointed he was with me. And although these people were in my side, I just couldn't my brain from ruminating about it and making me feel anxious, not good enough and just plain useless. I know I am not any of those but my depression has taken over and I just don't want to be around anymore. I just feel stupid that this one person had made me doubt everything I know, and I know he's not the reason, but he is the catalyst. Sorry for this rant, I think I just need to put this out there without scaring my friends with my thoughts. I hope noone has to feel a I do. But if you do, I'm sorry that you feel like that and know you are not alone."

The man clearly needs to put as much into trying to deal with his own problems as you do - not dish them out in venomous spite on someone else. Sounds like a bully also, as he chose someone he knew was in a vulnerable position - especially as he had not stated any expectations - to slate with his tirades.

I don't know what to expect but my GP says that she hasn't been contacted by anyone. The fact is, in this current climate of fear and aggression towards people on benefits, it's very worrying, and I don't need the hassle of it really. I'm doing my absolute best to find voluntary work, but it's in very high demand in London, it's difficult to find work that is what I want to do. I wouldn't be able to look for full time work unless I know what my capabilities are first, which is why volunteering can be considered very useful, if I could find some. The problem is too often if we look well people think we are well, never mind the fact that some of us don't want people to know what's going on inside their heads. Does anyone here have any experience with ESA and what I might expect when I receive a response to my claim? Has anyone had bad experiences with ESA?"

Sadly a string of difficult things happened, we suffered a death in the family amongst other things. With all of this happening I really went back to square one with my depression. Suddenly I had no energy again, I was feeling suicidal and had to reach out for help.  I was signed off of work for a few weeks, my friends and family have been wonderfully supportive and I restarted my medication. It was a very dark and difficult few weeks but it's been 5 weeks now and I'm feeling a lot better. I'm not stable yet, but I've improved dramatically.  The problem is, before all of this happened I had only been at my current job for 2 months. They have been incredibly supportive and understanding and have even paid me a full wage for the whole period I've been off. Now I am in a place where I want to go back to work, or feel that I should, I am suffering crippling anxiety about my first day returning. I feel I will have to field a lot of difficult questions and just feel in general that it's an insurmountable task. I can't even face going to my bedroom as it means I'll have to go to sleep and get up to go to work. So instead I'm just sitting here internally screaming. My coping mechanisms for day to day life seem to have vacated me.  I've been prescribed propranolol from the doctor at the end of last week, and I've been taking it for 2/3 days but it doesn't seem to be calming my anxiety.  Any advice on returning to work following a period of absence for depression?"

I feel like if I had given my supervisors the reason for my absence as soon as possible and returned, I would have made it back with their acknowledgement of my reasons if I couldn’t sustain it.

But what I’ve found from having a read around the depression forum is that people seem to have some coping mechanism, be it medication or having nurse support calling etc.  I’ve never been referred to a crisis team or explained those kind of options. I have 3 children and my depression started towards the end of my marriage with their dad. It’s coming up to 5 years and I’ve had ups and downs - been on anti depressants on and off. I don’t like how I feel on them after a while. And now I’ve been off for about 3/4 months I feel the stress is really high. And I’m just so low. No hope, feel no purpose to being, everything is on top of me, everything is a struggle and difficult.  I love my children more than anything and they keep me going - I think how they’d feel if I was gone and I’m all they have. I’m the only one who cares for them so deeply. At the same time I just don’t feel like I can cope with so much - and I just feel irritable and miserable and like I don’t like living.  I just wonder if there’ll ever be change. I feel so up and down and just don’t know which way to go after years of trying so many different things. I’m exhausted and tired of trying.  What coping mechanisms do you have? How do you focus on “fixing” yourself when you have so much responsibility ? No family, no support."

Exhausted people are open to depression, and it feeds on itself.  Please, find somebody to talk to about this, who can help you build a routine to get you through the bleak days.

Changing a bulb seems like nothing, but doing that made me happy, almost, for days. You already do more than I do. I know you do.

The little energy i have goes into taking care of my kids. My plan is to try and take care of myself a bit better.

I am certain my eldest does sense something because lately she is coming up to me throughout the day maybe 10 or more times, telling me she loves me and wants constant cuddles. Which is lovely of course, but she wasn't has affection before.  My girls are 7yrs and i have an 11 month old, turning 1 in 2weeks. My eldest sees her dad every fortnight on a sunday for a few hrs. Court ordered child arrangment. He does want more but hasn't yet taken it back to court. Very volatile past and a whole other story.  And my babies dad has never really put much time or effort in. In fact i have recently stopped contact because i'm sick and tired of his no show and other reasons regarding his intentions to be in her life.  It's all just a mess but here I am trying to soldier on doing it on my own. It is a lot to deal with for us single mums. We try our best though.

Its really frustrating because I am actually very social and open minded so it hurts to see people dont care about being my friend. So im lonely.   I completely understand. Depression leads us to want to be alone and shut away from people/ the outside world. So we become more isolated, which in turn makes us feel even lonelier. It's a vicious circle. I find it hard to maintain friends, I push people away when feeling low and now i feel i don't really have anyone to turn to. Always stuck-in with my daughters too. Sometimes i don't want to go out at all.  Do you have family support, anyone you can talk to about how you are feeling? x"

Yes it's only £14 a month which might not seem much, but when you are on benefits it does seem like quite a lot actually. On the same letter there is a bit in large print which boasts that council tax wont be going up at all next year. That means, in a nutshell, the rich are better off but the poor are worse off. I do some work but it's voluntary, I don't like what I do but I stick to it because I can't find anything else. There is also a limit to what I can do because of my illness. I'm basically doing as much as I can do, but for the government it seems that it's never enough. I do believe that at the same time as benefits are cut, there will be tax breaks for the wealthy.

Like wading through treacle.  Over the years I've learned a few thing that help me. Breaking tasks down into small ones (as i've mentioned before) and coming back to the same task again. Hanging my t-shirts and shirts on hangers after they have come out of the wash and are still damp helps enormously when it comes to ironing them.  I put my breakfast out the night before and cover the cereal with a plate - so I know in the morning I have less to do as the mornings are hardest for me.  Get rid of the hoover and get yourself a cordless dustbuster and electric cordless sweeper. Much less effort than the spectre of the hoover. Of course I'm assuming you live alone. I live alone and so I don't have anyone to help me do those jobs so I've had to find new ways to get them done whilst living with exhaustion.  Taking my dog for her walk seems impossible sometimes to the point that I almost resent her but then I remember she gets me out of the house for a bit. There are times when I can cry at the thought of having to do things when I don't have any energy left. Unless you've experienced it - it's hard to convey how frustrating and confidence eroding it can be.  I really find that doing things last thing at night when my energy is at its ""peak"" makes them seem less daunting somehow.  I find if I have to clean the fridge etc....I no longer have a big debacle over it - I simply do one shelf at a time with some diluted bleach spray and kitchen roll. Much easier than taking the whole thing apart and pulling everything out and really just as effective.  These things might seem trivial to some people but to me they are extremely important. Doing them is the difference between being independent or going completely under and having to ask for help from someone. So; anything we can learn from one another is vital. Personally speaking; it would make me feel much more depressed to live in a dirty or untidy house and I find that the small sense of accomplishment I get in doing them; helps.  Of course we all get good days amidst the darker ones and at those times I wish I could press a button to keep it that way.  Don't blame yourself and if you have endogenous depression that is a chemical imbalance then taking the rocky road of endeavoring to try another medication might improve your energy levels. Although it's a real journey that one with no guarantee at the end of it. For me - lustral really gave me a lot of my life back a few years ago...until it began to stop working after 3 years.  all the best robert."

I really believe it cleans better than the big and powerful vacuum I used to have. I can carry it about and it does a great job with little effort and noise (big plus if you have pets in the house). It actually cleans and takes up that micro particle dust too.  I've done a bit of research and the best cordless sweeper is the: GTECH Cordless Sweeper 7.2v NiMH SW02. You can find this at a few places online such as amazon. It has the power to also do relatively deep pile carpets and has edging brushes also (mine doesn't).  It's one thing I can't recommend highly enough. I've often thought of how much my mum would have loved these fantastic pieces of kit as they really take a lot of the hassle out of cleaning.  best wishes robert."

3018,Depression Forum,91262,I don't know what's wrong with me? Help please :(,2014-07-28T18:42:36+0100,author,True,27512,London,Phezzz,"Hi everyone. Not sure if I'm posting this in the right section so mods feel free to move this if necessary.  Basically, I haven't been in a very good place lately (well not lately - for a long time). This may be a bit of a long post so please bare with me - I will try to make it as short as possible.  I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and panic attacks when I was about 17 (I'm 19 now), mainly anxiety surrounding my health, social situations, and general anxiety. On top of this I was diagnosed with insomnia at the same time. I was given CBT to treat it which didn't work, and I'm currently on 20mg of Fluoxetine/Prozac which doesn't seem to be doing much so far, but I've only been on it about 5 weeks.  However, I definitely have more problems than anxiety and insomnia going on which I haven't discussed with my doctor as I'm just scared to. I go from feeling overwhelmed with emotions/situations/full of anxiety, to feeling numb and empty in pretty short spaces of time. I would suspect bi-polar (my mother was diagnosed with this) but my numb/empty episodes can last from a few hours out of a day to an entire week, which seems a bit too quick for bipolar related disorders, and my depressive episodes don't seem to completely relate to a normal depressive episode, and then I will go to feeling 'normal', which to me is a mixture of energy and anxiety. Sometimes I can feel both at once, which is EXTREMELY confusing to me as it's contradictory to feel numb and overwhelmed at the same time, but it's the only way I can describe it. I also have problems in social situations and relationships, constantly feeling like I'm going to be abandoned by my friends, or that they don't like me, or that I'm annoying them. Even though I seem to push most people away when they get too close, I still feel abandoned even though sometimes it's me doing it.  Sometimes I just feel completely disconnected from everyone around me. For example, this morning I was walking down the road and it was almost as if I was looking upon myself from above (not physically doing this, but this is the closest I can get to describing it), and feeling like people around me were robots. The thing is I KNOW that they're not robots deep inside, but it feels like they are. It's a slightly similar feeling I get during a panic attack actually, but not exactly the same.  Last night, I self harmed for the first time. I've been thinking about doing it for so long and have come close many times, but last night I finally took the plunge, followed by taking a few Diazepam pills and some wine to get me to sleep, more than I usually would take. I wasn't suicidal, I just wanted to feel something/do something outrageous. I've gone times today when I want to self harm, then from thinking 'why would I do that? It's stupid'. This constant game my mind plays with me, going from different states just sends me into confusion, and I REALLY want to know what it is that's wrong with me.  One reason I'm scared of seeing the doctor is that I don't want to tell my mum about this. She's going through a lot and I wouldn't want her to worry about it. I have friends diagnosed with various mental illnesses like depression, bipolar, anxiety and other personality disorders, and I can confide in them when I need to, but I just feel a burden but they are there for me when I really need it, and they seem to understand what I'm going through.  Basically, my questions are, what illnesses do my symptoms suggest to you? And what would I expect from a doctors visit explaining my mental state at the moment?  (P.S. I'm only asking what you guys think is wrong with me just to try and give myself a bit of clarity before I pluck up the courage to see a doctor. I'm not one for self-diagnosis but it's nice to know other peoples opinions on what they think it is.)"

I might move this to the depression area as this one doesn't get a lot of ""foot traffic"" and you need more contributions.  As you say, we can't diagnose on a forum obviously. I am diagnosed bipolar and I don't recognise those symptoms in what you describe. Being numb and agitated at the same time isn't odd at all. The numbness can be dissociation which is when our minds switch off certain areas when we can't cope. There is depersonalisation and derealisation (there is a third, my brain isn't working well at the moment, so can't remember it). The first is when we don't recognise ourselves in a mirror, for instance - which I have had. And the other is when we see the outer world as different or odd (your robots possibly?).  I think we get agitation at the same time because these defense mechanisms aren't working to help us. So you get the underlying agitation at the same time. Basically, I would argue, you are trying so hard to control things, you are now finding the mechanisms to help are becoming the distress in themselves. Looking below that is now difficult.  I think you do need to tell a GP and urgently. The reason is that your distress is progressing and they need to know that and soon. Being 19, SSRI meds can make people worse when younger. Its a well known side effect and your GP needs to know this and soon. You have to tell him that you wonder if its an SSRI reaction - I have found we often have to spell things out to docs! Also you say they aren't working anyway.  I would ask if there is therapy that can be offered and not just 8 weeks worth! You may need to ask to be referred to CMHT (Community Mental Health Team), to get this. If your experiences get worse, also ask to be referred to the Crisis Team. Now they aren't brilliant, but they are the Gatekeepers to a lot of other care. If your GP doesn't listen to you, don't give up just go back again and again. I had to see 6 before one realised that I was seriously ill! If you don't go back, they assume you are OK, so don't think you are making a fuss.  As for your mum, why should she even know you are seeing a doc? You don't have to let her know."

I'm definitely not a doctor, I just wanted to offer my advice and insight. My husband has been in and out of therapy since he was about 7 years old and he's been diagnosed with a long list of things-- and he does not fit neatly into any one diagnosis. Just want you to know that things are not always cut and dried, black and white, and there's a broad spectrum that you might fall somewhere in the middle on.  My husband is a self-harmer but he has been able to stop self-harming in recent years and I am thankful for that. Unfortunately his self destructive tendencies have found their way out through other means. I want you to get help ASAP. Even if you are not suicidal, self harm is a serious problem and needs to be addressed immediately-- you are very fortunate that this was only your first time and you are reaching out already. So many go for years and years without trying to fix the problem -- self harming is only going to do more damage. It might feel exciting, dangerous and you get an adrenaline high or endorphin rush that makes you feel better at the time but the guilt and self-loathing that comes from self harm outweighs the good feeling you may get -- by far. And the vicious cycle begins.  I'm glad to hear that you have been to therapy and you've taken the really hard first step on the path to wellness-- now you have to do some hard work. It's really vitally important that you tell your doctor everything. EVERYTHING. They are not there to judge you, they are not there to make you feel bad about your problems-- they are there to help you. They got into their profession because they want to help people. They are not psychics, they have a lot on their plates, they can't be expected to guess at what you are feeling. You have to tell them. It's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, but it's absolutely without a question 100% necessary that you spill your guts. Totally. Completely. Even if it doesn't link up, even if it doesn't make sense to you, even if it seems like a huge mess that has no rhyme or reason-- they will help you wade through it all and figure out what needs to be done.  I have found that it helps me A LOT to journal, write down my feelings, and organize my thoughts on paper to figure out what I am trying to say. I suggest you write a letter to your therapist and say that you are not really comfortable coming out about all of this stuff because you are afraid, ashamed or embarrassed about it-- but tell them *everything* in the letter. It's a really effective way of expressing everything, to get the message across without having to say it to their face. A great first step to break the ice and get the conversation started without talking about it. I'm really shy and find it hard to talk to ""strangers"" about stuff, but writing letters has helped me immensely.  Being a teenager is hard enough-- I'm really sorry that you are struggling with all this extra crap. You can take comfort in knowing that you are doing the right thing by getting help now instead of ignoring the problems or hiding them for shame. That says you are a strong person who can take charge of your own life, not be a victim, and work towards the happiness we all deserve.  Mairzy <3"

Hey, thanks a lot for your fast reply  I wasn't sure whether to put it in the depression area, bipolar area or the personality area so I thought I'd just put it here. Feel free to move it wherever you think necessary!  It's nice to know I'm not the only person who experiences these symptoms. I just really want to know exactly what it is that's wrong with me . I will speak to my doctor about it on Thursday - she is very nice and hopefully will be understanding with what I'm going through.  The meds haven't seemed to make me worse I don't think - but they haven't made me better :/ so maybe an SSRI wasn't the right choice or I need a higher dose.  Yeah to be honest I would like to see a psychologist/psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis of whatever it is, and then have therapy from there. But I'm not sure what the process is on the NHS :/  You're right my mother doesn't have to know at all. I just feel bad keeping these things from her!"

Thank you for your reply Mairzy.  I'm sorry to hear about your husband, but I'm glad he's been able to stop self harming. It must be hard being in relationships with people like us at times lol. But that's my problem I think, I want to fit into a specific disorder as it will make more sense to me in my mind, whereas right now I'm not sure what's wrong and I just feel like I'm going mad.  I've tried the journal thing quite a few times before I go to sleep, it ends up being just a incoherent stream of thoughts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it doesn't seem to make me feel better or get things off my mind when I'm feeling anxious :/  Thanks a lot for your reply"

She referred me for therapy, and seemed pretty worried about my safety. She was going to keep me on the Fluoxetine, but then decided to change it to Sertraline, which I'm due to start taking this Thursday. She didn't say what my symptoms were, but said come back ASAP if I start feeling worse.  And to be honest, I'm quite annoyed. I really wanted to be told WHAT THE HELL WAS WRONG WITH ME, or be referred to a psychiatrist. I don't understand why she's put me on another SSRI - does she think I'm depressed? Because I don't feel like I have 'normal' depression with the amount of ups I go through!  If I start feeling more hyper/reckless on the Sertraline within a few days I will go back to my doctor and tell her. Do you think I should ask to be referred to a psychiatrist?"

I've been getting up at 6.30am because I get bored of just lying there (I know I wont get back to sleep). I feel the most tired when I'm on public transport, exhausted sometimes actually. I find that not doing too much physical activity helps me not to feel too tired, but I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts? How does this compare with their own sleep patterns? Could it be to do with having a delusion which I'm not aware of?"

I either can't fall asleep or I fall to sleep but then if I'm disturbed in the night, I can't go straight back to sleep and end up clock watching and thinking too much.  I have been living on power naps for years, I tend to play catch up with an hour or two here and there during the day when I can. I can't remember the last time I went to bed or fell asleep before midnight. I find the lack of sleep draining though. I wish I could sleep like normal people. It's an improvement on when I was a teenager though, in those days I was a proper insomniac, I used to just sit up all night, every night watching tv, reading, writing, whatever till I heard someone's alarm go off in the morning and I'd go to bed, maybe drop off for an hour or two and be back up.

I think I feel slightly calmer and for that reason I have been managing to get back to sleep again, despite waking up early. I still feel a bit tired but it's much better, and easier to handle. I think that I go through such phases with my sleep, and it's hard to explain what is happening. It depends on what I'm thinking about during the day. My self-diagnosis is that I'm always trying to work out what goes through other people's minds, I'm always improving on my sense of what is going on in the world, and what makes people do the things they do. I think that sometimes this goes in to an overdrive situation, and for that reason I don't sleep very well for a period of time. I also watch the news a lot! One of the big problems I got is that I can't sleep during the day?? It doesn't matter how hard I try I'm unsuccessful."

I think its difficult to just get admitted on your own say so. Usually you have to get onto the CMHT (community mental health team) to assess you.

I am really sorry to hear that you are really struggling but well done for taking the first steps towards getting help. My partner and I both suffer with mental health issues and she has recently been an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital. It was a voluntary admission but it was highly recommended by numerous mental health professionals. Her stay was difficult of course, it is not the same as the outside world. However, she described it as a break away from life (in a sense) because you are able to reflect/work on yourself without any ''outside world'' drama.  At this particular hospital, she was very well looked after, with professionals always there to help with anything, structured meal times and planned activities. It was helpful to her also to discuss with other patients and learn from them too and understand you are not alone. Of course everybody's experiences are different and all psychiatric hospitals are different. But her experience of it was a good one and she now has tools to help guide her better than before and has a different outlook on life.  Prior to the hospital admission my partner had contacted her GP, was on medication and also had counselling. So there are a number of options you can try before any admissions.  You should contact community mental health services close to you and stress the severity of your mental health and take it from there. From my own experience, you just need to be really honest with YOURSELF first about how you are feeling and also open up and allow others to support you.

As a child I had the most loving parents, they gave me everything I ever wanted. They were the most amazing parents I could ever ask for but the person I was most closest to was my grandfather. He wasn't just my grandfather, he was my best friend. We done everything together, he would pick me up friday after school and I'd spend the weekend over at his, we would clean his car, mow the lawn, go fishing, go for drives while I tell him how school was that week. When I turned 12 he passed away, I didn't understand death and I was so angry at him, how could he leave me? Where has he gone and why doesn't he want to see me? I can't describe the hatred I had for him. I started getting involved in things such as drugs, gang crime and other things. At 16 there was a gang fight between the gang I was in and a rival gang. A member of the rival gang was stabbed and killed. Me along with a few others were arrested, I spent 6 months on remand before going to trail. At trial I was found not guilty and the main suspect was found not guilty due to self defence. After coming out I decided I wanted to turn my life around and better myself, me and a close friend went to college together to study graphic design. We had plans to finish college and start a business together. 8 months into the course, he passed away and I lost all motivation to finish college. I went back into my old lifestyle, I was moving up ''ranks'' in the gang and becoming known amongst rival gangs. Someone in the gang who I thought was my good friend invited me to a party so I said yeah. There was no party, it was a set up to rob me. I was jumped by a group of around 8, beaten all over and stabbed in my butt cheek. I decided this is it, this is where I change. I got a job, I kept clear from everyone in that lifestyle. I met a girl from work who I got close to, we got into a relationship. This is where my life became even more hell. Things started out good, she seemed caring. After a while she spoke about things sexually. Including others into our sex lives. I wasn't happy with it and we argued, she told me the only way I can be loved or wanted is by allowing these things. So I did. It was hurting me, I went back onto anti-depressants but I allowed it still because I wanted to feel wanted and loved. There came a time where I started drinking and taking drugs to numb myself, one night we drank together and she invited a few guys over. I was drunk and she allowed them to do things to me, sexually assault me, rape me. I kept quiet about it because as a guy I felt so ashamed, pathetic, dirty and disgusting. I felt like I deserved it because of the things I allowed. Eventually the relationship ended and I was in a dark dark place. I attempted suicide via an overdose. I wanted the pain and suffering to go away. I spent time gaming, not because I enjoyed it but to kill time. I could go online and what felt like 30 minutes was really a few hours. It helped time go by. I tried letting people back into my life, new people but I couldn't, I couldn't trust anyone. I felt like I didn't deserve anyone. Then I started talking to this girl and I felt good. I let her in and we got closer and closer. There was times we would speak sexually and I'd bring up getting other people involved. Not because I wanted it, but because in my mind I believed it's the only way for me to be loved and wanted. After each convo about it, I'd cry because I know deep down I wanted to be loved and wanted without these things. She became everything to me, for the first time in my life I felt normal. She would tell me her plans in life and I'd listen, I'd sit there and think about how I'd love to watch her, be by her side as show succeeds. We spent every night calling eachother for hours and hours. Every day I'd tell myself today is the day I tell her about my past but I bottled it every time because I was scared. I was scared to show someone how pathetic, dirty and disgusting I am. I eventually pushed her away. She's gone. There's nothing I want more in this world than a chance to sit her down and explain everything, a chance to show her how good I can be, another chance to grow with her. I'm back to feeling lonely and empty. I hate myself and regret so much in my life. All the things in my past are haunting me. I slept last night contemplating an overdose . I've pushed more people away because I feel like I need to be alone, I can't see myself winning this battle and I don't want them to be hurt once I've gone. I'm going for a walk tonight and I don't want to come back. I want to just be free. I'm so tired."

It was different then, though, we were all about peace & love & psychic exploration & shit. But I knew some guys who had done time & some who did break-and-enters & stuff like that. Guys who kept a knife in their boot. I had two ""wholesalers"" & one was a sweet, gentle hippie with hair down to his ass & always went barefoot. My more criminal friends robbed him - all his cash & all his drugs, too. Knowing he wouldn't go to the police. Anyway, I quit drugs. You can, too. You can get away. I kind of had to get all new friends because once I was sober, I found it super depressing to be in those environments. I've been free of drugs except alcohol & mj since 1981. The sexual assault will need to be dealt with, but my advice is, get rid of the drugs first."

One of the things I've spent a lot of time thinking about is what I call our ""neutral"" mood, or default mood.  Now, I have BPD, with depression and anxiety, PTSD, abandonment issues... I'm kind of a mess some days. This doesn't help maintain a good mood, lol. So, my usual mood isn't happy. I mean, I'm not utterly miserable, but I'm not happy. So I ask myself why others can be happy so much.  I think when you have depression, you think of people who don't have it as generally being happy, and it bothers us that we can't manage that. But, I think we overestimate how happy ""normal"" people are.  Like, while we wander around in a grey haze, we think that others get to have a blue sky sunny day mood in place of our gray mood. I mean, yes, everybody has sad or angry or down days, but it doesn't consume their lives.  I think this assumption hurts us, that is, actually hinders our ability to be happier, or at least content. It makes us feel even more flawed.  I think the truth is that most people, without depression or other issue, aren't always in a default state of happy. Others have a neutral mood, too. Other people aren't always upbeat and filled with joy, much of the time they are just doing their stuff, just not feeling bad.  I guess what I mean is happiness isn't a constant state for most people, so we shouldn't feel bad that we aren't always upbeat and cheerful, too. We shouldn't make ourselves feel worse because ""we can't be happy"". We need to understand that a neutral kind of mood isn't a bad thing. Any mood that isn't bleak, is actually an ok thing."

Clean the house from top to bottom - do anything to Normalise your sleep patterns.

I have very little energy to do anything now and even my interests have been affected. I used to read all of the time and whenever I had time and now, I hardly do that anymore.  I would go for walks, go to museums and learn. I'd volunteer with animals, create dinosaur and wildlife projects made up of everything I knew and I'd paint pictures. I'd go to sleep on time at 10.30 each night and wake up at 7.30 the next morning. I had a great diet that was healthy and I used to clean a lot too.  Now, I sleep all of the time and some days I don't sleep at all, my diet is terrible. I hardly eat and when I do eat I won't eat for a long time after. I no longer read as much and I literally have to force myself to get up in the morning and to do the things I once loved. I've lost a lot of weight and I just feel and look terrible overall.  I have so many things that I'd like to do, I'd like to volunteer at museums and nature centres to further my animal care experience and to gain more knowledge. I'd love to learn how to scuba dive, join wildlife conservation groups and learn new interesting things. I'd love to be myself again!

I'm as close to Expert at recovering from depression than just about anyone unfortunately. Hello Darkness my old friend.  Part of the Mental Torment IS the lying about. They feed off each other. Something has to break the cycle and you can either go the Drug Route or the Natural Route which includes building tiny bricks of achievement into your life.  setting the alarm would be a Major Logical Step in interrupting the 12 sleeping jags.  Getting out of bed would be the next step.  No ones sugeesting OP go out to a barn dance but he/she HAS to take some sort of Accountability at some point.  if you read my other numerous voluminous posts you will see that I believe Self Care is The Key to Recovery and trust me ive found out the Hard Way.  If OP had something they really wanted or needed to get to, theyd be Able, most likely, to get out of bed. Most of us manage to get to psych appts for example. It CAN be done, as a Goal and there fore a step in Recovery, in and of itself.  Goal setting is really super important in Recovery from MI even if its a miniscule goal like interrupting endless sleep jags or getting in the shower that day.  As far as Gaming is concerned, its great if you use it as a Coping tool. Using it as a lifestyle will stunt your life just like any addictive substance. People don't recover from Addiction by Not Changing their lifestyle, they recover from Changing it.  OP I hope you took something from my advice. Ive had depression so long its no longer even depression and every Psych you can poke a stick at fiddling around up there  The Cutting Edge treatment for me personally is Self Care nowdays. Ive run out of medical options."

I just wanted to write about something that has been troubling me for a while now but I don't feel like I have gotten anywhere nearer to finding a way out at all.  So, a year ago, I started seeing a therapist. Before I saw a therapist, I wasn't very self-aware of my inner feelings (on hindsight) and I was fine sort of just trudging along, being able to do things like study in university and I felt like I was really passionate about my hobbies. I would do them as much as possible as I felt like I couldn't get enough of them. However, I was also deeply unhappy (although not quite as aware of that, I would often drink a lot of alcohol to 'forget my troubles' and so I could feel like I didn't care about anything just for a little while. I would also sometimes break down and cry after pushing down a lot of my emotions and running away from them.)  Fast forward to when I started trying to figure out why this was happening - I started seeing a therapist and I realised how unhappy and dissatisfied I was with everything. The crying spells still happened, and then came panic attacks and a loss of motivation and enjoyment in my hobbies. What I used to do 5 or 6 times a week became once or twice out of guilt and obligation. It's driving me crazy. I can't seem to find the motivation to do anything anymore and it makes me feel like such a waste of space and it becomes a cycle of trying to force myself to do things again and then failing and then feeling bad about being so useless and then trying to force myself again ...etc.  It's just become so bad that sometimes I don't really see a point in living anymore if I can't get myself to do anything. I don't actively want to kill myself, but I just...don't really care if I die either and sometimes I find myself trying to put myself in risky situations because I feel a pull towards just ending everything. I don't really know what to do.  Anyway, sorry if this is a really long post. I just wanted to explain my situation and any help/advice anyone can give will be much appreciated, I promise!"

Therapy is such a difficult thing to go through. It releases all sorts of emotions and feelings. I found that when I was having therapy it made me feel a lot worse at first and I turned to food to comfort me. I would say the difficulties you are experiencing is due to the therapy forcing you to remember and think of very difficult things. I would be honest with your therapist and let them know you are feeling worse and struggling. It may be the therapist reduces the intensity a bit to help. I would not worry about you not being able to enjoy your hobbies right now as you are going through so much and it is only natural you will not be able to focus on things right now.

I've heard that therapy often feels worse before it gets any better, I guess I don't have any faith that it will actually get better, but I will let my therapist know how I'm feeling about all of this. I think the reason why I still feel obligated to try and keep pushing through my hobbies is that my boyfriend and most of my close friends are really passionate about it and excelling in it and I feel like I'm being left out when I don't join in like I used to, but if it is making me feel worse, then like you said, it's not really a priority for me right now."

I’ve been down on and off since 2016 when my partner left me for another woman, it was really just the tip of the ice burg as my life has been full of trauma and abuse, but it was the last straw sent me spiralling, I’m sure you all know that feeling.  I’ve avoided taking pills, the doc sent me to a therapist in 2017 (she was awful!)  So, I found my own therapist who’s brilliant but since pausing my business last year (Covid) I could no longer afford her.  My partner is currently very ill in hospital, he’s been in a life threatening condition with several scares but looks like he’s on the mend. He may well be out in the next couple of weeks but is likely to be bed bound and will rely heavily on me. My daughter self harms and is currently doing her GCSE’s  I’m finding increasingly that I can’t cope with the stress of my partner, both being ill and coming out and the caring responsibility I’ll have, whilst having to look for work and trying not to stress my daughter out to the point of self-harming herself, too hard to cope with. Every night I’m having nightmares and waking up in panic attacks in a state of pure dread - horrible!  I spoke to the doctor. They prescribed mirtazapine. I was reluctant to take them and asked the doctor what to expect she said ‘nothing much but in a couple of weeks you might start to feel a bit better’  I took the first one last night and woke up this morning like I’d been hit by a train. Unable to co-ordinate my movements, weakness in my arms and jaw - I couldn’t even close my mouth without effort. I’ve smashed plates abd the entire contents of the fridge fell out on me, clumsy I guess and absolutely knackered!!!  I just had to go back to bed and try and sleep it off, when I started coming round I felt an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, I can’t function let alone like this!  What can I do?! and only now at almost 8pm do I feel any kind of ‘normal’ and am vowing never to take a pill again!  I’m hoping you might be able to convince me otherwise as I just don’t know if I can trust the doctors now!"

I took melatonin yesterday, but it's weak. I even woke up at three in the morning, and I've been sleeping well for about two months. You can try valerian. At least it's plant-based. Too bad you can't afford a therapist. Maybe you have to come to terms with the fact that dying befalls everyone. And I don't understand that with self-harm at all."

Physical pain causes the brain to release a chemical concoction that combats depression.  Ok, pills. Time to hit you with science. When you eat your acid breaks apart the food and turns it into chemicals required to power the body, in this case sugars. Meat yields protien. Your glands release chemicals to make you feel or act in a way. An example is your menstrual cycle. It feels entirly different than the rest of the month and that's because the chemicals change in you.  Pills are chemicals, refined so that only what you need is in it. Not all pills work correctly because everyone reacts differently to chemicals based on their own body's balance. When you take a natural herb like st John's wart you are getting say 10% of the thing your looking for. The pill is 100%.  Remember two things. First is that taking pills for the first time is changing your body so it feels wierd. You dont have enough in you yet, it takes a week or so. Second, if you find it does not work there are others that are entirly different but do the same thing and they may work. Its scary at first but when you find balance it's worth it.

Darling girl I only saw your post now and it’s hours and hours later. Oh dear, people so can’t put a timeframe on recovery from mental illness. Your mum doesn’t understand. A concept that was repeated to me so much when I was really sick I started to assume everybody was aware of it, has helped me and maybe you could share it with your mum? She needs to hear it: when you have a physical injury, like a broken bone, firstly - you know upfront the approximate recovery time. It’s pretty definite. So even though it sux, you know you have limited amount of suffering so you brace yourself. Secondly, there’s not really anything you can do to speed up the healing process except for put it in a cast and rest. No one would ever accuse you of not trying hard enough to heal your broken bone. It will heal when it heals and your job is to recuperate. With mental illness, you’re in un-chartered waters. You absolutely cannot put any timeframe on your recovery. At 2 months, you could be nearly recovered, halfway through, or sadly, still years away from getting better. It’s extremely frustrating coz the goal posts keep moving and you can never really gauge where you’re at. Your mum has to let go of all her expectations of how long you should take to recover. If she thinks 2 months is bad, she might be in for a rude shock (I don’t wanna be pessimistic- here’s hoping you get better very soon ❤️) Also, while there are steps you can take that will hopefully aid in your recovery (e,g. see a psychiatrist/ psychologist if possible, eat healthily, practice mindfulness, try to exercise (gently or go hard), do the things that soothe you, like light candles, get enough sleep, participate on the MH Forum, etc), sometimes despite trying REALLY hard, it still takes a friggin long time to recover. I’m not sure exactly what happened to you recently but it seems like it was traumatic and you need to be given space, time and compassion to recuperate and be kind to yourself. Your mum I’m sure really wants you to get better. But her comments are setting you back in your recovery, not motivating you to “make more effort” If you can help her understand this, maybe she will lay off you a bit. She doesn’t have to understand your pain, but if she can show compassion and patience it might make all the difference. I had a disastrous psychotic episode in 2013 that saw me held in a padded police cell for a few hours then kept in another padded cell in a psych hospital for a week (with only a bare mattress on the floor - no blanket or pillow) and another two weeks spent on the ward in a normal room. Then 2 more 5 week stays as a voluntary patient after that. A friend came to visit me from out of town maybe 3 years later and I still suffered terrible anxiety. I remember her saying “I thought you would have been better by now” which was crushing coz I had improved so much (having literally clawed my way back from insanity) but definitely still had a long way to go.

3142,Depression Forum,178005,"The end of my marriage of 25 years - completely and utterly devastated, suicidal and unable to face even the next hour",2018-02-28T16:53:16+0000,author,True,46790,London,Greycylinder,"The end of my marriage of 25 years - completely and utterly devastated, suicidal and unable to face even the next hour  Long story. I have been married for 25 years. We have one child (23) together and a daughter from my 1st marriage. She is 30. Our son lives at home.  It's been a stormy marriage - largely because my husband suffers from anxiety and panic attacks and he self medicates with alcohol, usually in secret. When he does this, he becomes verbally abusive and nasty. The last 2 years have been pretty awful and last April, just after our daughter's wedding (where he got paralytic), I asked him for a trial separation. It nearly killed me asking him for this but I thought I might find some relief once he'd left the house. He rented a flat an hour's drive away and moved out. I was totally and utterly distraught. I took an overdose which sadly failed. He didn't come to the hospital and sent our son to take me home where I battled on for a few more weeks in desperation, unable to work. I am no angel. I have had my fair share of depressive episodes and even had a very short lived and meaningless affair about 10 years ago. I don't blame my husband entirely for the failure of the marriage.  After a few weeks following the suicide attempt, I was admitted to a mental health ward. I had begged my husband to come back to me but he wouldn't. However, when I was in hospital, he rang the ward and asked to come and see the doctors there. I think his motivation was to justify his own behaviour rather than to help me. I had had a very difficult childhood with an abusive and alcoholic mother and a father who just let take all the flack she dealt me. He wanted the hospital to know that that was the reason for my breakdown, rather than him. When he came to the hospital it seemed that there were grounds for hope for a reconciliation. I had prayed and prayed that he would come back to me and we started to see each other again, although we were living separately. I was so happy. I was over the moon. I bought new clothes, made sure I was always upbeat and happy around him and I felt truly blessed. We had a couple of holidays together and they were wonderful. It was better than when we were 1st married. I can't remember a time when I've been happier. He told me he loved me and he moved back home in December.  I had major anxiety at Christmas because I was frightened he would start to drink again. In the end we decided to go and stay with our daughter over Xmas because he always behaves better with alcohol away from home. All went well but my depression and anxiety hit me like a ton of bricks when I got back home just before New Year. I was put on Mirtzapine and Questiapine and the the doses keep getting higher and higher and I am getting worse and worse. I am actively suicidal. My husband is angry, bitter and is accusing me of getting him back on false pretences by pretending to be well. He hasn't actually abused alcohol at all but I live in total terror. I can't work and have been signed off until 29th March. I can't imagine ever going back to any kind of normal life. All I think about is how I can die. Our house was on the market and we have had an offer on it which is fair. We could each take our halves and end the marriage but I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. I want to be with him and I want us both to be happy but should I just set him free? I don't think he feels much for me except bitterness and disgust. He looks unwell and isn't sleeping."

I actually managed to see a proper psychiatrist today at hospital and he is toying with the thought that I may have a mild form of bi-polar or some kind of personality disorder. In which case, it makes sense that anti-depressants are making me worse. I am kind of hoping he's right but it is still very scary. My husband actually came with me today and was kind and supportive. I am also going into a respite centre for 5 days next week and I am seeing the shrink again on 12th. He has very slightly tweaked my meds, reducing the mirtazapine by a 3rd but leaving the Quetiapine as it is. He is also going to give me some emergency low dose diazepam to help me manage the panic. If he's right and the new amended dose help then I might be able to see the wood for the trees with my marriage. It may be that it has to end or it may be that I have over-reacted to every little thing my husband does. I don't know but I do need to be 'stable' and I haven't been stable for years.

I started on 5mg then I was moved up to 10mg and now 15mg, but I saw my doctor yesterday and that's when he suggested 15mg but he wants me to end up at 20mg because it's not hitting one of my odd ideas/delusions. I said that the idea might be a part of me like a religious belief but he still wants to increase the dose. I don't think they cause sleeplessness, that might just be your difficulties rather than the drug. I experienced the nausea and stomach aches but that goes off after you've taken them for about 4 weeks or so, it does go off eventually.  To be honest I'm not perfectly sure if the doctor should be increasing the dose, but I'm going along with it anyhow to keep him happy, but I self medicate so I'm in control if I really get fed up with them. I'm not a danger to anyone else/myself without them, and I haven't been in hospital so I could always just come off them, but want to be delusion free."

3162,Depression Forum,360108,Unable to be happy,2021-03-04T15:03:49+0000,author,True,99677,London,Simonsays,"Hi I’m new here and not sure which category I fall within, as I’ve never been officially diagnosed with a mental health illness. However, I have suffered with issues for a while and although, I wouldn’t say any of one them are extreme it is effecting my quality of life. I suppose the obvious ones are depression and anxiety and I have previously seen someone for anxiety and been on a small dose of medication for it, though that was many years ago now.  One of the main issues I have is a sense of wanting/expecting there to be something more from life and never feeling content or happy. It’ always been I will be happy once I have the job that I want, or I have my own place, or I have a girlfriend but these things have all happened and I still don’t feel any better. There have of course been moments in my life where I have felt happy, but I can honestly say that I have spent more of my life (I’m 34 now) unhappy. The issue actually gets worse when I’m in a longer term relationship and I think it’s because, as I achieve more milestones (buy house, get engaged, get pets etc) I’m conscious that I’m running of ‘once I haves’ so I become more irritant about what else is there left in life. I’m on my third serious relationship now and I have experienced the same feelings in the past and ultimately the relationships have ended as a result. I get jealous of those that seem so easily contented and satisfied, feeling like everyone is able to enjoy their life more than I am. My life should be great as I have a good job, nice house, loving fiancé, pets, family, friends and compared to others I’m so lucky. I think that just makes it worse though as then I feel guilty for not being happy. I just can’t seem to enjoy things, instead of looking forward to a holiday, day/evening out etc, I just worry about what could go wrong and when I’m there in the moment I’m not really there most of the time, but just going through the motions. Although I have been in several relationships, if I’m honest I still don’t think I have ever been properly in love, but I don’t think I am capable of it. Moments that should be special just don’t resonate with me and I feel empty with no emotion.  I do also suffer with anxiety, mostly social anxiety. I’ve tried to meet it head on by making myself do daunting things like festivals, stag dos and extreme activities (sky dive, bungee jump etc) but I still get just as anxious about going for a pint with mates at the local pub. I think this has creeped back in now more so, due to the lockdowns and not being able to socialise.  I don’t ever feel suicidal, as in I want to commit suicide, but I do think about getting a terminal illness and feeling relieved about it, in terms of just feeling the pressures of life being taken away and actually then maybe I would finally appreciate what I have. I know this is a horrible thing to think/say, for all those that do suffer through this, but sometimes I feel like I would trade with them so that they can have my life, enjoy it and make the most of it. I don’t so they really deserve it more than I do."

I’m 24 and I’m out of work and so have been using my time to read on this forum and try to help the best I can. This has helped me get through my day to day struggles.  In my experience, physical/material things have never made me happy. I could never achieve happiness by escaping the negative but have had to embrace it.  In the past when I’ve seemed help people would tell me I lacked a job, money, friends, etc. And over time I’ve been able to see that I have more than most people and I should be grateful for that. I feel showing gratitude for the things you have heals the mind. Starting with the most basic like air to breathe, food to eat, etc..  I’ve also tried to only care about things that are true and immediate - Day to day activities.  I feel in your case that nothing exterior is making you happy anymore and that the only way forward is to look inwards. I have recently started to meditate and found has helped me stay more present bring awareness to my negative thoughts and gain new perspectives on stressful situations. This I feel is something you could adapt over time.  I have also struggled socially and I agree in lockdown it is much more difficult to get into the state of mind where you are socializing.

Some of those things have happened and I'm still not happy. I seem to be conditioning happiness to a series of future events that may or may not happen. I repeat to myself that ""happiness is today"" but my brain does not get it.  I used to have a fullfilling life and definitely felt better than what I feel today. I do suffer from depression and anxiety which had gotten worse due to a series of personal circumstances. I have some days that are simply horrible. I don't think anyone could understand the degree of anxiety I can experience. Last night I woke up terrified at 4am thinking about several catastrophic scenarios and started taking tranquilizers. I took so many pills that I cant get out my bed yet. I feel totally drugged.  I miss human company. I don't have anyone to talk or see and I think that's ione of the main things that crush my soul and spirit. A couple of days ago a guy came to change my bedroom windows. It took 7 hours to complete the job and I spend the whole afternoon talking to him about life, politics etc. I never felt so good. When he left I felt positive, full of life , re energized.

Talking about ""I should be happy"" because ""I have all the things associated with a good life."" There's a couple things that don't quite add up there, however, in my opinion.  One is that ""I should be happy"" has no meaning. It's a silly idea that doesn't reflect reality at all.  The other is that ""I have all the things associated with a good life"" doesn't necessarily make life good, as it doesn't seem to much change who you are. You're still you, just with more things, some of them good things, but they don't change you much.  I guess we understand all this but these ideas still persist, the ""should be happy"" business, and the formula (or checklist) to attain happiness by acquiring all the things that are supposed to lead to contentment, but for many people do not. What a disappointment, I guess, that there is no recipe."

I have seen several posts on here like yours Simonsays. Talking about ""I should be happy"" because ""I have all the things associated with a good life."" There's a couple things that don't quite add up there, however, in my opinion.  One is that ""I should be happy"" has no meaning. It's a silly idea that doesn't reflect reality at all.  The other is that ""I have all the things associated with a good life"" doesn't necessarily make life good, as it doesn't seem to much change who you are. You're still you, just with more things, some of them good things, but they don't change you much.  I guess we understand all this but these ideas still persist, the ""should be happy"" business, and the formula (or checklist) to attain happiness by acquiring all the things that are supposed to lead to contentment, but for many people do not. What a disappointment, I guess, that there is no recipe. Click to expand... ""I should be happy""  This is a cognitive distortion (Shoulds). Should statements (“I should pick up after myself more…”) appear as a list of ironclad rules about how every person should behave. People who break the rules make a person following these should statements angry. They also feel guilty when they violate their own rules. A person may often believe they are trying to motivate themselves with shoulds and shouldn’ts, as if they have to be punished before they can do anything.  For example, “I really should exercise. I shouldn’t be so lazy.” Musts and oughts are also offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt. When a person directs should statements toward others, they often feel anger, frustration and resentment."
3169,Depression Forum,360108,Unable to be happy,2021-03-05T15:35:26+0000,author,False,99677,London,Simonsays,"Thanks for your response JessisMe. It's actually helped just putting it down in writing, as I haven't expressed any of this to anyone. It could be Anhedonia related, as quite a few things listed there do ring true; For example I see food as just fuel and don't tend to ever enjoy it that much. My sex drive is also quite low. I want to speak to my Fiance about it, but worried she won't take it very well and jump to the conclusion that its her I'm not happy with. I did go to one counselling session at the beginning of our relationship to clear my head a bit and she found that hard to understand. She has a lot going on herself right now and I think I'm seen as 'the dependable one' so that makes it harder to share my problems as well. I've had a good friend admit to me that he has been struggling in the past, which would have been an opportune time for me to share, but I still couldn't bring myself to do it.  Thanks AdamPritchard - I know that I am definitely not driven by material things and would happily give my nice things away for a better sense of wellbeing and happiness. I have done meditation in the past, took to it well and it helped. I've just let it slide as life has just got in the way, but I know I should try and start making time for it again.  Marianda - Sorry that you are struggling so badly and that makes my issues seem much smaller in comparison, as I do have people around me (although they don't know I'm struggling at the moment!). I hope the forum is of some support to you."

Having them know makes it easier for them to recognise when things aren't going well, which means they can offer more support rather than make their own assumptions. It's hard to say exactly how you feel at times, but communicating that something is wrong is important."

I'll know for sure when the judge rules on the paternity suit filed against me. that may have been a joke.  In the summer of 1812, a young aspiring pianist named Emilie sent her hero a beautiful hand-embroidered pocketbook to express her admiration for his artistic genius. Touched by the gesture, 41-year-old Beethoven wrote back, offering some simple yet profound words of encouragement and advice on the creative life — an exquisite micro-manifesto for what it means to be an artist and what art demands of those who make it.   My dear good Emilie, my dear Friend! […] Do not only practice art, but get at the very heart of it; this it deserves, for only art and science raise men to the God-head. If, my dear Emilie, you at any time wish to know something, write without hesitation to me. The true artist is not proud, he unfortunately sees that art has no limits; he feels darkly how far he is from the goal; and though he may be admired by others, he is sad not to have reached that point to which his better genius only appears as a distant, guiding sun.  I would, perhaps, rather come to you and your people, than to many rich folk who display inward poverty. If one day I should come to [your town], I will come to you, to your house; I know no other excellencies in man than those which causes him to rank among better men; where I find this, there is my home. If you wish, dear Emilie, to write to me, only address straight here where I shall be still for the next four weeks, or to Vienna; it is all one. Look upon me as your friend, and as the friend of your family.  “I must choose between despair and Energy──I choose the latter.”  ― John Keats, Letters of John Keats"

Two years ago I had cancer. From being diagnosed, to surgery, to chemo, to getting the all clear took a year. I had a particularly bad time with the chemo (I had to be hospitalised twice and each round left me physically drained and exhausted). Following on from that, I discovered my daughter has been self harming, binge eating and making herself vomit. It's been a long and continuous road with her, she is doing poorly at school because of her issues, one night she claimed that her dad was drunk, had raped me and I was in hospital. Obviously this led to the police knocking on our door at 2AM, waking us up and we had to spend 2 hours with them convincing them that she was wrong. There's so much more, but I'd be here all day and not get to the point. Which is.....  I've quit my job (I tried to tell myself it was because I needed to be around for my daughter but in reality I think I went back to work too soon after the cancer, and I just feel like the company has moved on and doesn't need me anymore), I sleep in every day till the afternoon (I wake up at roughly 7am, go on my phone for a bit, then go back to sleep till 3pm, I have no desire to get out of bed), I've stopped doing household chores (we eat takeout most nights cause I can't be bothered to cook), I keep making arrangements to go to events but never go (this is a big one. I bought tickets to go and see someone I've adored for 30+ years, I should be excited beyond belief that I was finally going to see them, but when it came to it, I couldn't be bothered to get ready and go), I know I'm stressed out about my daughter, I can't be bothered to do my nails, wash my hair or even shower most days (longest I've gone is 2 weeks, pretty rank huh?).  I've avoided confronting this for months, but I just need to know people's opinions. Am I in the right place or should I just get a grip, life's not easy, right?"

The above part of what you said sounds a LOT like me, and I have chronic depression that has been caused by long term uncontrolled anxiety.

I'm a BPD sufferer and this past year has been very bad for me including a couple of serious 'incidents', the last one back in February this year...  I have tried to get back on my feet but my life still seems to be spiralling out of control. I have a great boyfriend who I met about 5 months ago who has gone to a music festival this weekend and I'm struggling with terrible insecurity and anxiety.  I've had to go back to sleep on the sofa at my mum's and i'm totally broke - I can't find a job now that I'm trying to go back to work and I feel utterly worthless. I know it sounds like self pity but I hope you all understand that it's not that sort of feeling, I feel like my heads going to explode and am on the brink on tears constantly...  I'm sitting here at home wishing I just wasn't here anymore because the pain in my head is so much. I feel pathetic and a nasty cow for not wishing that my boyfriend has a good weekend away because I feel totally abandoned - it's like the world is ending - he's away having a great time and I can't bear it - what kind of nasty selfish person am I???  Sometimes I can be so caring and loving and then I behave like this - I resent him for going and I hate myself for feeling so pathetic"

The awful thing is that I'm obsessing about my boyfriend at this festival and how much fun he's having without me. It was booked before we got together etc etc but I'm so insecure about anything like that at the moment.  I'm so so tired of feeling like this and meds that don't work and therapy I can't afford that doesn't give me long term results... unfortunately the only thing that makes me feel better and gives me comfort is the thought that I could always stop the pain by doing something stupid... I have to keep that thought in my head to make me feel better... I don't understand what's wrong with me and why I can't control my thoughts...  I obsess about everything and feel totally lost - I don't know who I am and I just don't fit properly with the world."

I know what you mean about being stable - I would give anything to function relatively calmly but I just can't ever see it happening. I destroy all relationships I have or I pick nasty controllers who end up making me even more of a mess than I am!  I'm just having suffering today and feel the worst I have in some weeks - you know when it's a bad one and you've gone past a point where you can regain yourself properly. It sounds dramatic but I actually think I despise myself, I have such a hatred for every part of me - mind and body.  You're right about the meds - I'm going to change mine because they're not stabilising my mood enough, I might as well not be on them!  Thank you for talking with me... it is at least something to know that somewhere people understand. Although some people try and understand (not my boyfriend - he doesn't understand it at all), but nobody can really know unless they've experience it and are aware of the extreme moods that we deal with... just how powerful it is."

It's really hard when our moods get the better of us and control how we act, and I think it's even more frustrating being on medication that isn't doing its job. Sometimes sleep helps me, or meditating if I have the focus, which unfortunately doesn't happen often and never when I need it most. Just try to hang in there and remember that you can always come on here to talk to someone who understands how you feel and has been where you are and come out the other side."

These friendships are true and deep.  Well, after knowing each other for a year, I reached out to one particular member, Rachel (32). She was having a rough time and I told her I cared for her, and wished I could share her pain so she could get some relief, that I longed to do that for her. We started talking every day and after a couple of weeks, in which I had come to think about her every second of every day, dream about her, I told her I was falling in love with her.  She was shocked, but only because she didn't think anyone would feel that for her. She told me that she had strong feelings for me too, and that she couldn't believe I was saying these things, that it felt like a dream.  We are 4,000 miles apart. Our conversation shifted to Discord. We started talking for hours and hours every day, pouring our hearts out, falling in love, deeper and deeper. I won't tell you the things we have said, but over the course of a month or so, I don't think the words exist to have said much more.  Then all of a sudden, she has a crisis. Says that she needs time and space to think, that it's too intense for her right now and that she needs to learn to be happy by herself before she lets me carry her burdens. It hit me like a freight train, terrified me. It felt like she was breaking it off.  Well, we are still thrown in together in this game, we still ""talk shop"" as it were. But although she's reasonably warm and friendly to me sometimes, much of the time, she's cold and aggressive, almost talks to me like I've done something wrong.  I know she has a lot of medication that she is currently not talking. Not for another couple of weeks. I've been trying to support her emotionally but she keeps me at arm's length. Now I don't know if getting back on her meds will mend the feelings she once had.  I love her more than anything in this world and my life is empty and pointless without her. Just when I thought I was destined for a lonely life, she came along and we painted a beautiful picture of the future together, started to plan it out practically. Now it seems like it's in ruins, and I don't know what to do.  The friends I have that know about this have got sick of hearing about it. I feel like I'm bringing everyone down with my overbearing emotions. Frankly, I think I'm fast running out of friends, like I'm a burden to everyone.

I am genuinely hanging by a thread to life. She is the sole thing I care about, and without the fragile hope of being with her, I don't think I will survive another day.  She has taken me to heights of emotion at both ends of the scale that I didn't even know existed. The things she said she surely cannot have forgotten so quickly. We both promised that we would never lose one another. She said she can't believe she had to wait so long to meet someone like me. Can't understand why she deserves to be the one to keep me, said I am the best man she has ever met.  Those that know her say it might just be because she is off her meds and by her own admission, that makes her tired and cranky and emotionally volatile. Maybe she means what she asks for in space to think. She talked about this not wanting to be toxic.  She is not on her meds again for another couple of weeks. I've been told to wait until then to broach the situation.

It's not a death sentence, or the end of hope, to be on your own in the present. Either you end up living alone or you do indeed find someone in time. A couple of relatives of mine met people later in life and married; it can happen. But first I think you need to take care of yourself. Emotions are powerful but you can make them seem even more powerful if you desperately want something. You attach weight to them. Be mindful of what you are doing and expecting and how you are reacting. Thinking you've fallen in love after two weeks would be a sign to me that you desperately want to fall in love with someone rather than the fact that you have actually fallen in love. It seems like you have idealised this person and made them somewhat perfect in your eyes. Take it easy, it will come, if not with this one then with someone else. All you need to do, if you want to find someone, is to mix with people, preferably in person somehow. Just remember that you want this a lot, that you need to slow yourself down some, and that it takes a long time to truly know a person. And above all, this doesn't have to be what life hinges on; this isn't life or death. People will come into your life, sometimes it just takes a little longer than we'd like. Keep the faith."

Click to expand... Hello Icarus, I read your post to distract myself from self harming and I found it very moving. It’s a breath of fresh air to hear straight talking mixed with vulnerability. I sort of relate to the behaviour that your gf is displaying. I obviougly don’t know anything about her background etc, but if she is getting flash backs and/or is a survivor of some sort of abuse, be it child abuse or domestic abuse, this may be the reason for her sudden intrepidation and her distant behaviour. She may be stuck on replay reliving past trauma and needs someone to reach out to professionals and inform them she has been triggered and needs help right now. Trust takes time to build and it is only with time that she may let down her guard again. Communication is key and ignoring her behaviour will only encourage it. Perhaps you can try addressing the situation by asking her to listen to what you are going through and gently explain how her behaviour has effected your wellbeing. I dunno, I’m feeling abit emotional myself now, so could be just projecting again! I wish you well and hope you can both continue to bond and work things out."

I’m very sorry that the person you love is pulling away from you. I’m sure she has her reasons that she may or may not choose to share with you. To put it bluntly I think you are putting WAY too much into this relationship and that is not good for you or your personal well being. When you say things like she is the “Love of my Life” and that your life is nothing without her, that is creating a very high pressure situation for her and a very high stakes situation for you. That is not fair for either of you. Love does not always equal relationship. We often love people who do not return those feelings. That’s just part of life. We all have to learn to adjust to relationships that don’t work out for whatever reason. Part of what helps is by taking what we have created as a high stakes situation and dialing it back some. Maybe this person is not what you have made her. Maybe the relationship was better and more real in your mind than it was in objective reality. Try to be kind to yourself. There is a way out of these feelings. Usually that way is to go through them and it will be hard. But eventually things will start to not feel quite so strong. You deserve to know where she stands with things. I would develop the courage and strength to ask her so that you can know what the future of the relationship will be, you deserve that much. Don’t let this be end all be all, however. Don’t let it define you because life has more to offer and you are much more than just one relationship. xo, j"

I'm a gamer myself and met most of my friends through those games. In my last relationship which was not through a game I was also quite smitten. She told me I was her soul mate and nothing could bring us apart. One day a week before Christmas she just ghosted me. I found out months later when she sent me a message that someone convinced her that I was lieing and using her. When she realized he did it out of jealousy she wanted to let me know she was sorry. This time I at least got a goodbye. That was a little over a year ago and I still feel that pain. I swore off dating, closed what little was left in my shattered and dead heart and embraced being alone which eventually lead me here to this forum.  I would love to give you the cliches but I wont. I would love to say be a man you'll get over it, you and I know emotions run deep. I still have feelings for her after all this time, the pain is still there. It took months before my suicidal episode ended. The only thing you can do is start doing things without her and make it the norm so one day a long time from now you'll forget to be sad because you wont accociate it her anymore. I had a favorite song I cant even listen to anymore.  Will things get better. Yes. Not because your scar heals but because you learn to live with it. It will change you. If your not careful it will destroy you. I embraced the Male stereotype of being cold and emotionless because it was easier than crying all the time. I dont reccomend it. All you can do is wait it out. The longer you hold on and she does not want a relationship the longer it will take.  I truly hope for the best for you. You dont need to end your life, it's possible another woman will come along the same way. Whilst I agree ""get a new one"" is entirly unrealistic remember she came along and you never saw it coming. If it happened once it can happen twice."

We eventually met up and started a relationship, at first the excitement and feelings of love were still there, but as time went on(to cut a very long story short)it faded..  We both realised, the excitement was in the 'Game' ..He nor I, were nothing like our characters in that game..yeah, he was the same considerate, lovely person, but close up together, there was something missing..  I know this may not help you as we all feel nothing or no one else could possibly love someone like I loved them, not even close............

I thought you deserved an update. Well, I continued to support her, being what she needed and when, knowing when to be close, when to offer comfort, when to give her the space she needed, to let her breathe.  Well, ultimately she got her meds back, and with it her emotional stability. She welcomed our warm conversations back into her life, and for past couple of months, things have gone from strength to strength. We talk for 6-10 hours a day. She tells me I am the sweetest and most amazing person she has ever known, that I make her extremely happy, make her feel warm and fuzzy every day, and that she trusts me implicitly, knowing that I not only love her with every fibre of my being, every bit of her, and always will... but that I also know how to respect her boundaries, respond to her moods, things that are very important to her. I'm learning on the job here, but she says I could not be doing better.  We are drowning in each other right now, (in a good way), deeper every day, enjoying each other's company in every way, providing for one another, and planning our futures together. We know how to handle the blips now. We understand each other better than ever. I think everything is going to be just wonderful.  Thanks for your help guys. I wish you all the luck in your own difficult situations. ☺"

In the past I've always achieved grades that I'm more than satisfied with and have held high hopes of a successful career. My parents are incredibly supportive in everything that I do, and on the whole I feel happy with my friend group and have never really had issues in that regard.  However, things have taken a turn for the worse recently. It's that social aspect that I'm particularly concerned about. For some indeterminable reason I've become locked away, separated from the people I would normally associate myself with. I resist social interaction when I can. People have noticed and asked the casual ""are you okay"", but no one has reached out for a deep conversation. Maybe that's because of the limit I've put on my interactions, but in my current state it's hard to neglect the possibility that I'm simply far less valued than I previously believed I was. I experience an inner conflict between knowing I need to overcome this problem yet feeling that on some subconscious level I enjoy the self-deprication and pain I put myself through.  So far, it sounds more like social anxiety disorder than depression. But the truth is, the feelings of worthlessness and persistent sadness drag on in my alone time, which incidently I seem to be having a lot more of given how closed I have become in the social regard.  It feels like a vicious cycle. I interact less, so I feel worse, and the continual, never-ending downward spiral in my mental state means I continue to interact less, continue to doubt myself and forever feel there's no way out.  I've never purposely put myself through harm but now I feel it's happening on a level I can't influence. My friendships are deteriorating, my studies are suffering, and my positive perception of self no longer seems to exist. I'm at an all-time low."

No-one can diagnose on a forum but I would suggest that more is going on than social anxiety. Has something triggered this? Can you look back to when it started and see a connection? It might be something small which set off a chain reaction in you.  I think you need help and should ask for some soon rather than wait to see if it goes away. Pills aren't the be all and end all by any means, but they can be a useful stop gap whilst we look for something better to help us , like therapy of some kind. I would nip this in the bud before it gets worse."

This is often the case with the police too, angry with the service generally and not you so when they sigh, it is not about you but about the service that is failing you. Most of them will feel very sorry and worried for you but they maybe feel without the skills needed to help you or realise they should not get too involved as it is important they remain detached for their own emotional health.

With the home treatment team I was told once that I could see them every day in their office by one of the mental health nurses in a&e but my CMHT had to agree to that plan which they never did so that was also a dead end.. With my housing situation it's because I'm only renting a room at the moment and I won't have the home treatment team going in and out while I live like that and I was told by my old psychiatrist that they would try to house me through the council or social services but then they suddenly changed my psychiatrist in September and no matter how many letters or phone calls my GP and the RAID team does to him I have still never actually seen him  I've been to a&e to see the team before I've hurt myself but they have never done anything and it has never worked  So I'm not moving anywhere just standing still in the same spot which mean that a&e has to take on everything

I sat there for two hours because i was so desperate.  You are severely ill if this has been going on even one month and deserve to be escalated to the top of the pile. You are eligible for this help, working or not. They use whether you manage to work as a measure of severity but they shouldn't as i used to sit in the toilet cubicle on the phone to the helpline most days and cried in my car before and after work.

I've been calling like mad to the point where the receptionist actually hangs up on me I have gone to a&e and asked to be admitted because I was really suicidal and just felt done with everything and ended up being sent home just to return the next day following an overdose and actually had to be brought in by police because I didn't want help anymore I wanted to die so they had to sedate me. That time which was sept/Oct I ended up being admitted to the mental hospital since I wasn't just a danger to myself anymore but to others as well  I don't really wanna go off work sick as work is kinda the only thing holding me alive and sane at the moment I do enjoy my job and it makes me feel like I have some purpose but it's really had making it through a day..

For me, when i went sick semi permanently in my mind, the pressure was off and i started to cope better. I hope that down the line i will return to it but i know right now i have to work on myself. If you keep in mind that 10 + years ago you would be a long term inpatient and be signed up to Incapacity benefit for life, it shows just how difficult it can be for us and how that was understood by all. I wouldn't go that far with myself but it helps me to see the bigger picture and see that i really have valid difficulties living even if the current government has a different viewpoint. I'm not saying give up, i am saying it is something worth thinking about.  I understand the purpose aspect to work and my identity and self worth was tied up with my job but since stopped work temporarily/not sure, i have realised i have other talents and other purposes which i continue to do. It has given me time to organise a file with certificates and references and reflect on what i have achieved, value myself and my skills, and think about what i want to do in the future. If you going on sick leave gives you access to the home treatment service then you may need to think about that.  It is difficult to stop and be left stranded but i felt that i could stay afloat that way. I'm sorry i don't mean to push you into anything i just feel that sometimes it helps even though it doesn't feel like it would. I gripped onto my job for about three years and when i stopped, the pain was tough but the relief was tough too. Many people take career breaks. If you are in crisis so much you need to work on that maybe rather than working at work. Maybe you are the work that should take priority for a while.  You have received extremely bad treatment by your service and don't think for a second that it is acceptable or your fault in any way. The service appears to recruit hard bitches the majority of the time and once you have bitches as the majority, those respectful staff do leave to work in more positive and respectful environments. They have bigger psychological problems that you or i, and clearly no empathy. I could never ever hang up on you and i wouldn't say i had loads of empathy myself but it is inhumane.  I don't know what else you might do other than look for an alternative service. I would ask those nurses plainly what you should do. They ask us what would help us, well you need to ask them what they expect you to do when in crisis because their service clearly is not suitable for you and what is the alternative? They need to refer you elsewhere because otherwise you will end up in a coffin without a doubt, or you will end up with severed arteries, run over or in organ failure. This is no small problem. You are seriously ill and in trouble here and their lack of action is inhumane.  DO NOT EVER THINK THIS IS YOUR FAULT OR THAT YOU DESERVE THIS.  I am going solo myself but it took years to be able to do that. I spent years very sedated and sleeping, years going from counsellor to counsellor privately, and for the last six months i have been doing very little other than looking after myself and i am doing a great job of it.  Keep going to a&e before self harm. Keep doing it and keep telling them. Keep calling them, keep going to see them, because someone will listen eventually. You will gain access to a decent psychiatrist who will help you. You deserve help and should have received it long ago.  Purr"

I understand what you are saying though but it seems to me that it actually does help Alex at the moment.  BTW I actually did go off sick for about 7 months (in three different periods) and the first time helped but the other two times actually made my situation worse and when I moved to my new department I went part time from full time and sometimes wish I hadn't dropped down to part time but hey.  Anyway Alex. Please keep on bugging the CMHT. I know it's annoying and tiring but they need to be badgered sometimes. If you do end up in A&E do you think you could ask if they could back you up if you write to PALS about your treatment as that might help?

You have articulated your feelings very well in your email to me, and how you are struggling with the strength of emotions that you are feeling. I look forward to seeing you again next week so that we can talk about these things some more.  Unfortunately, because your email, and a similar one that you sent to Rebecca, indicate that you are at risk of harming yourself, I have had to inform the safeguarding lead at the college, and a social worker from Islington mental health team. We have talked before about the reasons why I have to do this in my job, so I hope that you will understand.  Best wishes,    So I reply back saying :  Argghhhh no one cares .. My dads full of it he won't do what he says .. Sorry can't make it better .. It's okay for everyone to hurt me .. If I died today no one would care .. I'm sick off all this .. No one understands ..

I keep fantasising about harming, I haven't harmed seriously since February but I keep feeling like my arm is buzzing almost physically aching to be harmed.

If you can bear th efeeling and not block it, but just sit with it,it will subside of its own accord. The mind cannot hold an intense emotion for long and it goes within a relatively short time. But that is only if you can sit with it without doing it. It takes courage, but if you block the emotion, it gets stronger. It feels counter intuitive to let the feeling flow, but try it once and see if it helps you. But don't SH please. BTW I had to edit the post as any reference to specific self harm is not permitted as there is evidence that it can create unhealthy reactions in others. Take care xx"

I often think about it especially if i'm stressed!  Try rewarding yourself for ""good behaviour"" like a sleep in or a magazine or something you've wanted for a while and if you slip up, take something away, like your morning paper or your chocolate treat.

But the thing that matters is the desire to NOT act on these thoughts. The longer you resist the thoughts begin to go away eventually. If things begin to feel like there on a slippery slope you should try some distraction techniques because they do work you just need to find the technique for you. i can easily push aside any thought of self harm, wheather that be bulemia or physical harm .. i just listen to some music or write a story even just take a shower. after a while you just begin to think youre being silly."

I have been resisting and resisting so hard to not listen but I am really struggling. I am under CMHT but I feel like I can't be honest with them because when I did they just threw the MHA at me, so I just tried to contain myself as much as possible and both me and him hate hospitals and hate being contained in environment we don't like. He says I'm a failure for not doing good enough in protecting him, and hiding his presence, yet he keeps trying to assert his presence.  Ok I'm rambling.  My reason not to is I hate having scars that I need to deal with for years after. It took so long for most of the old ones to fade so it is not as obvious but still visible.

There are other ways to release or express negative thoughts and feelings than by self harming. Listening to music, making art, getting in some rigorous exercise, writing in a journal, these are some alternatives for release without self harming. Don’t let the voices sway you to do something that you know is bad and might not want to do. Take the best possible care of you because you are the only you that you have. You are worth it. xo, j"

When I have either harmed myself or thought about harming myself, it's been because I've had a huge pain or a huge anger inside of me but no way to express it. Or, no one to hear me express it. Sometimes self harm can seem like the only way to authentically express what you're feeling, I understand that.  So I guess some reasons not to do it would be things like, you care about your future (although I have been supported by people working in MH with self harm marks..). Also maybe that, over time, there are other ways to learn how to express the feelings you have without hurting your innocent, precious body.  I'm speaking as someone with huge laceration marks in very visible places, and, if that's what you have to go through too, OK. You will have been doing your best given the circumstances. What I've learnt is that, the way I relate to my emotions, even extreme ones, can change over time. Ways that mean I rarely think about hurting myself anymore.  With patience and the right people to support you (maybe you don't have the best right now, which sucks), maybe you can experience that change too."

Absolutely nothing. There was no stress relieving at all. Self-harming didn't made me feel calmer, or pushed my problems aside. It only was another annoyance that I had to withstand along with the things I already had to put up with in a daily basis.  Take my advice.

I realise that to get out of an abusive relationship can be very hard. It often feels that it is not as simple as just go, is it? But you have a family, so could you consider moving there just to get breathing space? If she can't cope, then that is her problem. From what you wrote, I am hearing that she hurts you, she lashes out, then shouts that you promised not to leave her, so you should stay. That right? But you promised to not to leave a woman who treated you with respect, not a woman who hurts you. Think that through.  Ending your life is not an option really.

That's obviously not a good way to grow, it is negative and self destructive.  You need to find ways to be more positive towards yourself. Think of how God or Buddha might see you, from a standpoint of infinite compassion, and see if you can treat yourself and others that way. You will end up in a more positive space, and if you allow it to influence your life, also maybe among more positive people.  At the very least if you absolutely, positively gotta beat something up, use a pillow, it is kinder towards the walls and your hands!"

Some people say that suicide is the cowards way out but i don't really buy that, i think it definitely does take courage to do it. Some days all i do is sit and think about suicide but one of the reasons i don't is because i know if i hang on long enough there might be one day when things seem a bit brighter and on those days i'm glad that i haven't done it. The only problem is that as time goes on the brighter days become fewer and fewer till there's hardly any at all and they are so far apart i don't know if i can hang on till the next one comes. And then there is the problem that you don't know when the brighter day is coming and how long it's going to last for when it does eventually get here.  I feel on a knife edge continually so that even when i'm feeling slightly better about things all it takes is one little push and i'm back in the pit of despair again trying to pull myself out and not knowing if i've go the energy or even if i can be bothered to go through the whole process again. It seems as though it takes such a lot of effort and patience to pull yourself through the darkness but it takes just one tiny thing to put you right back at the start again and you think to yourself oh no not here again i really can't do this again. So each time it just get's that little bit harder to stop yourself thinking this is the time to end it, now's the time for suicide. At one time all i used to do was think a lot about suicide without actually acting on it. I see it as an inevitability rather than a possibility. I tell myself that yes i'm most definitely going to do it but i try and find as many reasons as possible to postpone at least for a while. That's always a good tactic when you have reached the stage when you know you are going to do it, find some reason, any reason for postponing it at least for a little while. Then i always try and think of someone i'll miss, that's important because you'll never get to see them again so you have to remind yourself of that, don't think about how much they'll miss you...be selfish and think about how much you'll miss them. I tend to invest a lot in only very few people, i shower them with love almost i suppose to the point of obsessiveness at times, but i do it because they are the only thing that's keeping me from taking my own life. Yes i might give a lot to them but also take a lot back in the strength i draw from them. I don't always tell them but sometimes i do. If they are genuine friends they'll understand. Good friends are worth more than anything in the entire world.  Nevertheless i still get that feeling that i live on borrowed time, that the day get's closer when i take that last OD and i know that it's going to be the last one. I think in some ways i'm sort of mentally preparing myself for it. It's not something you can just go out and do on the spur of the moment. It's almost like the end of a journey but the only difference is i'm choosing when the journey ends whereas most other people (people not reading the entries on this site for example) follow the journey through to it's natural conclusion. I never wanted that, i always wanted to be in control of the ending. It always bothered me that we are not supposed to choose when we exit our own performance, why shouldn't we? I've had to endure years of this torment so why shouldn't i decide when i've had enough of it? I never got a choice in most other things in my life and i at least want to have the choice to decide when it's time to stop it. The bad days seem to get more and more and the good days seem to get fewer and fewer, so few that sometimes i wonder if there are any good days left to come. I think maybe we know on some level when all the good days have been used up and there are no more to come. I can remember a time when i was so depressed that i'd just lie in bed for the entire day and not bother to get up, i was majorly depressed but didn't contemplate suicide at the time because somehow i knew that there were still good days to come and i just had to wait for them to come and ride out the storm. I could feel they were coming, taht i hadn't used up my quota of good days. But you do sense it when the end draws near (many of you will know what i'm talking about, you'll have felt it yourselves), when all the good days have just about been used up. You try desperately to cling on and hope it's not the case but you know deep inside what the truth is and that the time draws near. Then at the time you know it's no longer 96% or 97%, it's time and you wish it wasn't but you know in yourself. Of course people will try and talk you out of it but you will know and nothing they say will make any difference.  So in answer to your question, yes i've had the conflict myself. I think we all have that's why we are here on this forum. It's nice to know that you are not alone but the only problem is when you have got to that stage where all your good days have gone and you know they have then you will feel very alone, very very alone. And i think that's the way it's supposed to be. Let's face it, it was never meant to be a fun day out in the park. We all knew we were going to lose one day and that it was inevitable that's why we came to places like this, we wanted safety in numbers, to know that we weren't the only ones. So if you are at 96% or 97% or higher then all i can say is i'm here with you. It was a long hard fight but it had to end somewhere i suppose."

This is not about people thinking you are bad or not, or what others think. This is about paracetamol - the danger is that you can feel fine for 48 hours ofter taking them, and then, as the poison in them starts to work, they destroy your liver. So 2 days later you start to have immense pain, and bleeding, and you gradually can die. I am NOT exaggerating.  Whether you like it or not or want to hear it or not, you HAVE to be grown up and get help and soon. I am not sure about the amount you took and how dangerous it is - but you really must not take the risk. I had to edit the amount out, as per rules on here, but I know how many you took. Paracetamol is Not a safe drug you can mess around with.  You are clearly in need of help and that is why you are taking ODs. if you go to the hospital, they can get you that help. if you need to talk to someone in person, ring the Samaritans - they are very good and can really help too.  I am not judging you, and I am afraid I am telling you what to do. I do care very much what happens to you. xxx"

I know you say that you don't want to hear this but I agree with everyone else - you SHOULD go to hospital.  I'll tell you a little story (admittedly I'm sharing this as I hope it might shock you into action. I don't mean that to sound cruel, please know that I'm trying to help you!)  About 3 and a half years ago I decided to commit suicide. I'd agonised over it for around 2 years and decided to do it with a massive OD. I know I'll be edited if I say how much I took but it was a lot, a cocktail of various pills, including a lot of paracetamols. I'll try keep this short and not go into everry little detail- basically I got to hospital and I was absolutely off my head, totally out of it but it did work out in the end. BUT, I was told that I had taken a lethal amount and that I would have died from the amount I'd taken, if I hadn't sought help. It wouldn't have been pleasant either (so I was told) apparently I'd have died slowly and agonisingly, probably from organ failure and internal bleeding. Even if you have'nt taken a fatal dose SA, you could still do serious damage, BUT that is much LESS likely if you get yourself to hospital now! Even if you feel fine now you might not in a few hours. Tablets don't get into your bloodstream straight away but they will eventually, you could become VERY poorly!  Please, please seek help. People here are worried about you, and I'm sure you have people that would be deverstated if anything happened to you. People aren't just trying to use scare tactics on you, they are telling you the truth.  I sincerely hope you get to hospital asap - you NEED to be helped! XXX"

I have communicated this to my partner, the suicide hotline and others but there does not seem to be any way out. I have recently come to the conclusion that my future is ruined. I am estranged from my family, however I was lucky enough to be taken in by my partner's family. They're very poor so life has been all grind (not that it was not before). I thought that my life would turn around if I got a masters degree, a good job and then maybe I would be able to live my life independently. That doesn't look like it is going to happen for the next 10 years (if that). That masters is useless for what I want to do, as the estrangement and other issues combined with my own stupidity have left me with grades that are lacking. I cannot use it for what it was intended and I am doomed to an office position I hate, unable to save, unable to travel when Covid lifts, unable to see friends, unable to keep up with friends or achieve anything I'll ever be proud of.  I do not want kids and my partner is already talking about them. I have not had the chance to live on my own or live a normal life in my 20s. I had a girlfriend who tried to blackmail me, who in turn became addicted to heroin and nearly bankrupted me. I had friends I would see every day, but as I've hinted at they're all around the place doing what they love, going on holiday, travelling to new countries to do interesting things. I am here, stuck and reading what my prospects are. Every time I do I just feel that I am a failure. Some people say I am not, but they mean it in the sense that I am a good person? Or something? It's not exactly clear. The point is everyone seems to think that I should be grateful for having a future that is unremarkable to me. Boring. No excitement, nothing to look forward to, no one to help me reach my potential.  No one has ever actually given me any advice. I've figured out everything on my own. I learned to fight, pick up girls, research, write, shave and a whole host of other things on my own. I've never had someone tell me I'm worth something and that I could do great things, just that I am a good person. What is that worth? What exactly am I supposed to with that? Will that pay the bills? Will that give me access to a good life? If the choice is between living a great life or nothing at all, I see no reason to not take the latter. Am I being unreasonable? Is there anyone that can help me?  Thanks,  Dwig."

I hope you can use the forum for support during this difficult time.  If you’re thinking about suicide and are in immediate danger, please call your local emergency number (i.e. in the UK call 999, in the USA or Canada call 911, in Australia call 000 and in New Zealand call 111) or call the international emergency number of 112.

I have had over 100 visits to a&e in about 10 months and have permanent nerve damage. I have taken ODs mostly not huge but they are beginning to affect my health as I feel bleurgh most of the time. I have been trying to get help from the cmht for a long time but they just take the stance of your self harm your responsibility - they basically ignore the fact I am destroying myself. They say that they will not section me because it will do no good and I'm glad about that because I don't want to lose my freedom  What are people's experience of their cmht or health professional and your self harm? Did you get any help or did you feel they just turned a blind eye

Some even see it as attention seeking.  I'm going to ask because I'm trying to understand a little more, Why do you self harm so much?  I self harm myself and I also have more than one method but nowhere near as much as you do, only when I need a release from my emotional pain or feel I have to punish myself but I do try my best to distract myself.  Maybe they feel that by giving it more attention it won't help? You never know what CMHT's agenda really is.  Maybe look up yourself something like a talking therapy like CBT for example (but not the only one) and put it forward to them. Let them see that you are trying to help yourself. It should be them looking things up but sometimes even if we don't feel we need to, we have to prove by taking some action that we really want to stop ourselves.  Does that make any sense?

My self harm spiralled when I lost support, my job, friends. I do it mainly to make myself feel better but also like you say to punish myself for being a bad person. Also I'm addicted. The worse I feel and the more rejected I get by people the worse my self harm becomes. I don't see it as attention seeking maybe you do. I have never had an a&e attendance for an OD, nobody outside of a professional setting knows that I self harm I always keep scars covered and would be far too embarrassed to parade them. I only go to a&e for wounds that need seeing that I can't really do myself without botching it."

However, on occasion, he did, and I just pretended not to notice and changed the topic. Today I got a call from his number on Facetime, which I thought was weird but I picked up, It was his wife, she was so horrible, she was screaming at him, saying awful things about me, Calling me names, making fun of how I look, calling me fake. I felt so crushed. I did try to explain it was nothing like that, but... she just called me a ""little girl"" (because I look a little young when I haven't got makeup on) and started demanding to know how old I was, and started screaming again, I just lied about my age, because.. I didn't know what else to do. Truthfully i'm early 20's.  After the call the things she said about me just floated around and around in my head.

It's not your fault that she grew jealous. Of course, she had a right to be, but not because of you. Her husband was the one sending flirty messages, so her growing angry with you isn't completely justified. In a way, I can understand her frustration, as a lot of women believe their husbands/boyfriends shouldn't have female friends. Personally I disagree with this but I can understand it to an extent. I'm sure her anger with her husband blinded her in the moment. However, that's not an excuse for her to be nasty towards you. Those things she said about you are not true, they were fueled by anger and jealousy. We often say horrible things when we are angry, and it's even easier when it's someone you don't know. She wouldn't know anything about your true character, so you shouldn't let those insults bring you down. It's also so easy to insult someone's appearance. Calling someone ugly or laughing at them for how they look is almost always an indication of insecurity on the bully's end. Your intentions with her husband were good, you said so yourself that you believe you are a good person. All you wanted was a friend to lean on during a hard time, it's his fault for occasionally trying to take it any further. I'm sorry that you lost him, but honestly it doesn't seem as if he would be a good person to rely on anymore. I don't know him or what he's done for you so I only say this based on what I do know. He put his own marriage in jeopardy and didn't consider the feelings of you or his wife. If he is your only friend who is able to support you I understand why this might be particularly difficult. All I can offer is this forum as a source of support. Just being in this community with people who know what it's like has helped me tremendously. And you can always message me specifically if you feel like making a friend Remember that you are a worthwhile person, those things she said about you are absolutely not true and I can tell.

You need to see him and get help and see if something can be done to make life easier for you. Does it get worse with any triggers? I find being tired makes it all worse. Its like I have to be on alert in case something happens. Hopefully they will understand a little better after that and maybe realise how much more you have to work just to keep going. Take care xxx

She left me out of the blue after 7 years to experience a new relationship with someone else she met.  Unfortunately through the relationship I had gone to great lengths, having been left homeless and disowned by my family 2 years ago as punishment for pursuing her. The efforts I put in weren't always reciporicated.  The idea stemmed from my fiancée who used to self harm in her teens...it helped her cope and it just felt the right thing to do.  I've relapsed today after 5 weeks of holding it off and feel as though I'm going back in to a spiral. I'm a 24 year old man with a full time, respectable job - this isn't supposed to happen to me. What coping methods are out there to help fight off the urge? I don't want to self harm any more."

Self harm feeds on itself and never works. It seems to release some tensions, but then that lasts for a tiny amount of time. Eventually, you are faced again with the same problems as before. I would suggest you could look into asking for help from Relate - (used to be Marriage Counselling - but not been that for ages now). They help people who are in difficulties in a whole range of reasons to come to terms with these problems, including getting over relationships when things go wrong. There is a waiting list, but they are very highly trained and I recommend them."

I have never had suicidal thoughts. Have I had thoughts of events happening to me whereby I end up severely injured? Yes, but in these thoughts I would always end up fully recovered. I always feel I have to hide myself, I always have to be the bubbly one, the one others can come to for help. I'm not always bubbly and happy, and by not being, I am told I am in a 'mood' or 'grumpy' by my partner. I have things going on in my life, which will not be fixed quickly but these are insignificant compared to what others may be going through. A close friend, tells me she is worried about me, which makes me think, why do I want to burden her with what is actually going on in my mind? Also what would happen if people knew? Would I lose my job? Would it be on my medical records? Would my friends see me differently? I have no idea when it first happened, I had been thinking about it for a while, thinking what is the least obvious, my job involves bare arms and my family would notice, when all of a sudden I just did it, I hurt myself. For a few weeks this escalated up to 2/3 times a day, not every day. After a few weeks this was accompanied by episodes of bulemia. Both these incidents stopped the night before my close friends wedding. I am now on my 3rd separate episode of hurting myself, unsure of what makes me stop or start again. All I know is I get a sudden urge/need to do it, followed by an addiction to continue. As weird as it sounds, I am not ready to accept help, if that is what I need. Why would I need help? I don't have an issue, its just a blip. I am just trying to understand what I am doing."

It gives you something that you want at the moment and release endorphins that make you want to do it again. Many people harm for different reasons as a way of controlling something, to release feelings you otherwise wouldn't feel you could, some people feel like they deserve it e.c.t If you look it up there are lots of different reasons and you may look at it and realise that one of them fits how you feel about it.  It can be really hard to stop when you start and that's why I don't think it'll be a blip. But I also haven't currently sort help for my SH so I can't really say much about what happens. It's definitely not a phase and even if your not quite ready to get help about it there are methods you can try when feel the urges coming on to try and stop you from doing it. There is a page of this forum with lots of people's ideas.  Hope this helps. And sending lots of love and support. X"

The last time I had self harmed before this year was when I was around 18, I am now 24. 25 in a few weeks And now I think about it everyday since I began in July. I feel the urge to do it when I’m extremely depressed and panicked due to my ocd and anxiety. I feel the urge to do it when I feel numb and empty but still depressed because of how I am. Ive started to feel the urge to even do it when I’m having an ok day, without any breakdowns or intrusive panicked thoughts. This is not good. why do I want to do it on relatively ok days ?  I did it last night and I’m about to do it again, because I don’t care anymore. im tired of fighting. I’m weak, mentally and emotionally so I feel like I deserve this pain. why can’t I just get up and live my life ?  my bandages are running out and I’m going to buy more because even though I want to stop, there’s a part of me that no longer cares and wants to do it again.

You know, I've been on another similar forum to this and have noticed others holding such similar views. The thing is, you can't really quantify and compare one person's problems with another. Each one can get affected by the same or similar situation in different ways. The important thing to recognise is when someone is hurting as a result of whatever problem/issue/situation they are being exposed to and to support them. Not to be dismissive or invalidatory. If this place provides a handle for you to try to apply the brakes when you feel things are about to spiral, then write away if it helps.  SH as I might've mentioned before can be a difficult thing to break as not only can it be out of pure habit, but also because of that part of your mind that craves such a thing.

Please go to your GP and let them refer you, or treat you. You sound quite young - am I right?

I also feel pretty embarrassed, like it was so naive, so dumb of me, to think it was over. I saw my leg in the mirror today and I felt really stupid, I had this voice in my head telling me 'ho woaw you really though you were done with it huh ?'  I hope to resume my total abstinence and I know it will be difficult, especially if I do it alone. Nobody knows, I only ever self harm on places that I'm sure nobody can see, and would hate to have anybody close to me discover it.  I come to this site to discuss with people who are experiencing the same difficulties and who are therefore likely to understand me. How do you deal with relapsing ? Does it happen a lot ?

You seriously don’t need to keep bullying yourself and I think the most important thing to learn here is that you are your worst enemy instead of being your best friend.  Start each day off right by being kind to yourself. Start some daily pampering habits and work on eliminating your self hatred.  Create a harmonious atmosphere starting with you first. Each and everyday make sure that you and your atmosphere are living harmoniously. If you have to write this stuff down each and everyday, to remind yourself , even better.  Remember, we only have to manage one moment at a time. You CAN do this. Break it down. It’s one day only and repeat. Start creating new healthier habits and incorporate them into each day.  Journal writing ✍️ and I don’t mean on your phone, is probably your easiest but best tool available.  It doesn’t happen instantly so you need to work on patience. I think we all do. You aren’t that different than the rest of us. You are just open and honest with your feelings.  Congratulations for being so open. It takes true courage. That’s an admirable strength."

It is a really long journey. When you talk abt 'daily pampering habits' what do you mean ? (my first language isn't english so maybe that's why i don't understand what it means)  You're so right about the one day only and repeat, someone close to me is in the AA, and I found that everything he learns there, I can apply to me, especially the thing of 'you don't say 'ill never drink again', all you can say is 'i won't drink today' and repeat it tmrw, and the day after, and after, etc'  How do you do journal writing ? Like what do you write about ? I draw a lot, that's my main hobbie, and i think that really helps me, even if what I draw is never direclty related to self harming, its still helps me deal with feeling of frustration or anger i can have toward myself. When I get really focused on it, I can fill sketchbooks really quickly and it feels like a good shower. In some way expressing it on the page kinda makes things more clear, less messy in my head, its like putting my room in order. I guess its a type of journaling"

I started doing that because I had a lot of feelings to sort out after relapsing, but doing that helps a lot because when I'm close to relapsing I think about those entries and I can notice patterns and be like, ""I was okay after I felt really bad last time, I have worth without punishing myself, my streak is important to me"" and I just cycle those thoughts as long as I can until I pass enough time to come down from it and be a bit more grounded or tired. Legitimately sometimes I have to just put my head down on a table and think about how important my streak is to me. It's been six months or so since my last relapse and it was a minor relapse. I have found that my relapses have been with smaller and smaller actions even though the urge is still really strong sometimes.  I believe in you. This stuff is hard, but you're stronger than it."

That was true, and I am completely fine. I have now labelled my tablets to prevent a recurrence.  The thing is, two weeks before that, I DID OD. It wasn't an attempt on my life, I must stress. Whilst I think about it, I have no intentions of acting on it, of that I am completely sure.  I think it was because I just don't want to feel anything. You know, in a weird way, like a sociopath. I want to be able to 'not feel like a human,' and not feel the things that I am feeling, even though I know I need to feel it. I have always been very sensitive, and I think I have an adverse reaction to emotion, I always tend to feel thing ""strongly,"" and I don't like that. When I am happy, I always try to get out of it, when I am sad, I always try to get out.  I want to tell my T. I do. I feel like this is a very particular stumbling block which may prevent success in therapy. On the flip side, I worry about the repercussions. I worry about how she will react.  ... and now I don't want to feel the stress and feelings I am feeling now.  Has anybody else felt this way, have any advice?"

He asked if I was suicidal and I answered no because right now I'm not actually suicidal and he asked if I wanted to see the mental health team and I answered no on this as well but he goes against what I say completely and put me in suicide watch in the observation unit and calls the mental health team and threatened me that if I would leave they would call the cops on me. I stay then I didn't really want to get the cops on me to be honest so after 2hours a psychiatric doctor comes and sees me and I have no idea what the first doctor aid to him but he thought I was suicidal as well and had to argue with him for more then half an hour to actually let me go home and that I wasn't suicidal.  Do they really have the right to put me in suicide watch if I'm not suicidal and I've always had the choice to see the mental health team in a&e can they really force you to see them?

I start to pace and panic and it calms me. On good days i will go for a walk but i did use to run it off. Whatever IT is. Anxiety?  I find getting out is a good way to manage it. I am confident that you will eventually find other things to replace self-harm. Somebody said it is like an addiction as once you start, it is hard to stop. That isn't an excuse to not try to stop. It is like smoking, hard to stop but very good for you. People smoke to reduce anxiety. Alcohol and smoking are a socially acceptable way of self-harming (that doesn't get you on suicide watch!).  I don't think self-harm in moderation is ok though. Some people can have a beer every other night, some people drink ten. I think you are in the ten category, so it is better to refrain completely like alcoholics have to do. I think you should aim for that. There are other ways to cope, you need to decide to swap self-harm for something else. It would be very easy on a bad day to go too far and end up physically disabled or dead, just like alcoholics will eventually have liver disease.  I'm am lecturing you! No, i'm worried and would like you to find another way to cope. I like to bake cakes. It quiets my mind and lets me think through whatever i'm anxious/upset about.

With alcohol and smoking you can make it less tense but it will just be as full and still on the edge of breaking but with self harm its like opening it up and release a bit of what's inside so it's not on the edge of breaking anymore

It was here are sleeping pills and good luck with someone coming round everyday for about a week. I was told the only free bed was in Canterbury! but they just did not want to admit me although I was crying and pleading with them to send me to hospital. What do you have to do to get in? when I looked on the feed back site for the little brook hospital Stone lots of people went in as voluntary patients with out any hassle at all so why was I refused??? is it a case of if your face fits??

He has if I was safe and I said a straight no and told him what I was planning to do, which I carried out but not to the extreme I was planning cause something stopped me.  You know what happened?

It always comes back and bites me in the face. You see, IF I then get admitted I get to hear that if I've taken an overdose, it was just a small one so I just want attention and I'm faking it. If I literary asked for help then I get to hear that I can't be that bad because I still have a sense of asking for help. It is getting literary to the point now that next time I'm in a crisis, and I actually still am, when I'm planning something (my CPN knows I am, I've told her, there's nothing she can do, cause ""no beds"", not an ""acute threat"") I won't turn around and ask for their help. The things I heard from some of the nurses and even doctors that are supposed to help me is absolutely disgusting. Don't get me wrong, some of them are brilliant! But if I'm in the position where I want to take my own life, where I can't keep myself safe, or where I even have already taken an overdose, and then have the genius idea to call an ambulance because I have a teeny bit of survival left in me, then I don't want to get slapped around the head with ""oh you just want attention""!"

As an adult due to distress and low self esteem/depression. In my distress I don't feel the pain at all because my mind is overwhelmed by the incident to which is causing me to self harm, if you see what I mean. I do know I harm in two different ways. My worst harms have been due to other people causing me distress, even once at the police station when I had to sign a form I stood there and just decided to self harm. I was wrestled to the ground and ended up in a cell with a badly bruised shoulder thanks to the heavyweight cop. I was duly told I was a sick puppy I view my self harm as signs of my distress.

I have always found that the more I asked the less I got so I just gave up and told them to stuff it basically then they started throwing therapies at me left right and centre. They definitely like to be in charge but when you stop letting them control you all of a sudden they are desperate to get that control back.  Sometimes it is a dangerous game they play when you are self harming or saying you are suicidal and they turn you away. I think I finally figured it out that when I had a care coordinator I was only offered the crisis team or hospital because my care coordinator was looking after her self and her job - didn't want anything to come back on her. When I no longer had a care coordinator all that stopped and was never offered the crisis team even though I was just as ill.  I think they also take the attitude that they can't stop someone killing themselves if they really want to

I have an MRI Friday coming for the headaches I have been getting and convinced it’s bad news, has anyone else had this? Thanks, LC"

I'm pretty sure there's a sub-forum for Health-related Anxieties. I'm terrible at paying attention however, so I'm not 100% on that. But, I know from experience Panic Attacks can cause you a woooooooooorld of trouble, even physical ones. Many, even myself on occasion, have felt like they're literally dying during panic attacks. Of course, that's the point of a panic attack: in a way it kinda feeds upon itself. Numbness is about the only symptom you've mentioned that I haven't personally experienced thanks to anxiety, but maybe other people have; I'd ask around. I used to be a Hypochondriac, and good lord it is freakin' awful. Always worrying about any given illness I may have, always terrified and constantly seeing doctors about my health, only for everything to come up negative. Maybe this sounds familiar. I don't know; but either way I hope you find it helpful to get your fears off of your mind here, and perhaps to hear of other people's similar experiences. Take care!"

I lost around a stone in weight over a couple of months and had chronic insomnia, vomiting and low-mood. I was also having panic attacks frequently. I started on antidepressants and they have been incredible. They've really helped my low mood but I'm still having panic attacks - which I think may be work-stress related.  I work for the NHS in Psychology myself and currently I'm under a massive amount of stress to complete a certain number of mental health assessments within a very short period as we've been commissioned. I've been told to do this alone as we can't recruit another 3 members of staff (they left suddenly) which has meant I'm constantly bombarded with calls, requests and recently complaints due to the time for reports to be completed (I'm part-time). I'm not really qualified to deal with all of these clients and don't have a supervisor at present. I've found myself constantly being mentioned in emails and managers being linked in with criticism because I've missed calls and haven't responded to people in time. I had to take 2 weeks off work in August with GAD as I was going days on end with sleeping and eating - I ended up being signed off by my GP. I've met with all my managers and the head of our borough this week, who are all disgusting with my caseload and amount of pressure but there's going to be a several month gap until new people can be hired. At present, I've found myself making admin mistakes and finding it impossible to manage everything even when working 12 hours a day. The panic attacks have started again and vomiting (which my GP has diagnosed as anxiety induced) and I'm sleeping for on average 4 hours per night. I've had several managerial meeting but nothing seems to be resolved and I've found the vomiting and palpitations are pretty much constant at the moment. I'm really struggling to sit-still at all.  I know that if I go off sick, none of these assessments will be done which will likely make the anxiety worse but I'm really struggling to know what to do in this situation. I suppose I'm a bit stuck because I know if I'm signed off then I'll worry continuously about the clients who aren't being seen, but I know that at the moment I'm making mistakes and unable to manage all of this which is then leading to more criticism and anxiety worsening.  If anyone has been in a similar situation, I would really really appreciate the advice."

You've already said this is causing you to make some mistakes and it's really no surprise. You are overloaded and overworked, alongside a place that is currently understaffed! It's completely unfair and unrealistic expectations that are being put on you.  If you were to be signed off, you sign yourself off mentally as well. It's none of your concern about the clients (I know it's great that you do care enough to be concerned about that), it's the managers concern. You being off will force them to do something, because they cant not have your role filled, surely?  No job is worth making yourself unwell for. Your health is more important."

Then about 3 hours later our smoke alarm went off its a noise I've never heard so I woke up in complete panic looked outside and the street lights hurt my eyes!.

My whole body was soaking wet within seconds!. But now I feel absolutely fine. I was thinking food poisoning but that normally carrys on whereas I feel fine now.. slight headache but I'm ok... could this be my body's reaction to being so scared?? I'm literally overthinking this so much now! And extremely scared it's going to happen again!. X

It’s quite common with anti-depressive medication that you will feel worse before they will start working. Often you should give it a 8 weeks period until you can see any effects or if it’s not working.  The side-effects can turn up a few weeks later, so it can been delayed. But it can also hide that it’s truly a depressive episode kicking and the dosage isn’t right. So best would be speaking with your doctor and tell that you are getting worse. Citalopram might be a medication not suitable for you.  I hope that they listen to you"

It is very addictive and should only be used for a short term period. There are many antianxiety medications in the UK. Citalopram can be taken for anxiety too. It is often prescribed for panic attacks. It may be you were not given the correct dose as you started on 20mg then dropped which needs to be done slowly.

I am allergic to Penicillin and Codeine. Amoxiclav is a member of the Penicillin family so that might be your sensitivity.  Day Nurse contains Pholcodine which is a member of the same opioid family as Codeine...and Neurofen contains Codeine - so there are common denominators in these three medicines.  Always carry antihistamine pills. Suspension Piriton (antihistamine) is strong and works far quicker than a tablet because a pill takes half an hour for your stomach to break down.  There are alternatives for all medications so please don't worry - I've managed just fine."

We did long distance for about 6 months and with my own issues and her anxiety it wasn't easy, but we made it. She moved to London and we have had many ups and many downs. I dont think I've ever truly understood her anxiety and how it affects her, it mainly comes up in arguments on how she deals with things which is never good and havent had a proper conversation on how she needs to deal with things until recently. The last 6 months we have been on and off. The last few months she has had A LOT of stuff going on at home with family sickness etc. Considering how far away she is from home this has made it very hard for her. She started to want space and time alone and I started to feel as if she didn't want me, so I kept pushing to see her and saying I feel like she doesn't want me. We ended up having a discussion to sort it all out. She said I said everything she needed to hear but she didn't feel any better or different. She then gave me a hall pass as I was going to Amsterdam that week, which I took very badly and we argued again 2 days later. When I got back from Amsterdam she decided to end it with me. She keeps saying I'm the love of her life but she doesn't see it working.  I've been listening to as many podcasts and videos as possible on understanding anxiety before and I don't think I've ever realised quite how much things affect her. Is the breakup a fight or flight kind of response ? Is it making her see me as a threat/danger so the solution is to get rid of me? I've bought a book called 'The Worry Trick' which I'm going to read over the weekend. Does anyone have any recommendations on books or articles etx  What do you all think?

I dropped down from 20mg to 10mg mid April after being on that dose for 5 years. I had a few days feeling a bit uncomfortable but nothing as bad as what a lot of people say. Then i was fine and felt generally quite happy. Now all of sudden I’m feeling rough now (end of July.)  Symptoms include: head pressure, bloating, acid, brain fog, feeling empty, general stress and tension, feeling a bit wired, anger, anxiety etc.  I am wondering if anyone else had a delayed withdrawal onset? Seeing as I was on 20mg for a fairly long time? Or have I just ran into an unforeseen bad period?  I am still aiming to get off them altogether so I can feel the good things in life and try to manage the bad emotions rather than mask them. However when I was on 10mg years ago I found the dose not strong enough to have any benificial effects just a few of the bad symptom ones.  Now I’m wondering whether to gradually start the process of getting off them altogether or just settle and go back up to 20mg Any input much appreciated thank you."

I'm a 20 year old gay male, and for the last few years I have been experiencing waves of intense periods where I feel incredibly nervous, restless and overthink situations to the point that it causes me to feel more nervous and quite nauseous. I have always brushed it off as nothing, and used to think that I was level-headed, and so could deal with any problems I had by myself, but recently the frequency of these waves has been increasing, which I think is mostly being triggered by stress surrounding my sexuality.  I am out to all my friends, and have never had a problem with being gay per se, but I am not out to my parents. I have always said to myself I will never come out to my parents (not until I have graduated university, have a stable job and am financially secure etc.) as my dad is openly very homophobic (he went mental when he found out I had a gay friend), and has told me on multiple occassions he would disown me if I were ever gay. We disagree on quite a lot of things (he is religious, tries to enforce it on me etc.) and I feel quite disconnected from him emotionally. I feel like I have a 'duty' to maintain a relationship with him because he supports me financially at university, put me through private school etc. We don't have much of a relationship anyway for me to care much about being 'disowned' by him, but the idea of being cut off financially and excluded from the comfortable bubble I have grown up in causes me a lot of anxiety.  The stress caused by going to an academically very intense university hasn't helped either; I've now found myself feeling fear and nervousness over things such as interacting with other people or passing exams, and whenever I'm left alone I will overthink these issues to the point that I have started having what I could only describe as panic attacks. I feel guilty because I am a fortunate person who comes from a well-off family and goes to Oxford, and so I tell myself that I shouldn't be having anxiety or feeling down because my issues are insignificant, but this only causes me more stress and the cycle continues.  The tipping point was this morning when I overheard my mum talking with a friend about me probably being gay (I'm pretty sure she knows, but she is the type of person who would be very supportive, and so coming out to her wouldn't be an issue at all if it weren't for my dad). This overwhelmed me with a whole load of thoughts about eventually having to come out, feeling guilty for not being able to tell my mum, and I have been an emotional wreck all day, feeling extremely nervous, dizzy and like I'm destined to never be at ease and have a happy life.  I really don't know what to do at this point or how to ask for help or if I even need help, and I'd really appreciate some advice and what I should do.  Thank you so much in advance and sorry for such a long post!"

If your thoughts are impacting on your studies I would certainly try and speak to someone in the university. Do you have some kind of student guidance centre or anything? There may be some support there. With the coming out to the parents isn't anything I could help with as I have never been in the same shoes. I really hope it works out for you. I really hope your dad comes around and won't let his beliefs come between you two.

I suffer from health anxiety since 2013. I thought i had managed it a little while being busy with my job and looking after my son etc Just a month ago, i was admitted in the hospital with bad stomach pain and was operated the same night for closed loop obstruction, it had no underlying cause nothing chronic. Surgeon said its just happened and they cut off the part of the lower intestine which had no blood supply. they said we have fixed it , now get on with life. this is my 6th week into recovery. My health anxiety is horrible, confidence at the bottom and thoughts that never end. i am at google most of the time... fearful horrible thoughts. My surgeon has been super helpful and reassured me million times. first my brain was fixated on my wound recovery and now the why.... and how... and just searching about this..  i dont want to be on anti anxiety. in 2013, i was put on xanax and this health anxiety started from there.  reassurance and talking helps a lot."

3838,Anxiety Forum,118503,I get paralysed with indecision and anxiety – any advice?,2015-08-03T17:05:13+0100,author,True,40187,London,jojeba,"I suffer from terrible indecisiveness, which I write off as a symptom of my anxiety. I go round and round until it becomes impossible to make a decision.  It's always about whether to DO something. ie. once it was whether to go camping with a couple of people up north; I fully panicked with while trying to pack, and sat on the floor surrounded by gear, but paralysed with indecision. This time, I'm wondering whether to go to a festival. I bought the ticket months ago to go with my ex and his friends; no longer a plan, as he has a new girlfriend! So a couple of months ago I decided I'd go on my own, but try and coax friends to come. Nobody wanted to go.  Finally, I decided I'd sell my ticket and get the money back, and that way I'd also save the extra costs of going to the festival. I could do with the money. But last minute, a friend has told me she is now going to be working at the festival - she's free in the evenings and has begged me to say yes. So I said yes. But it means I'm on my own for the majority of the festival, which makes me anxious. I've spent the last three days flinging from excitement about going and being spontaneous and meeting new people, which I am sure is what will happen… And utter panic about how much it will cost me, and whether I'm really going to have enough fun to justify the expense or if I'll just be kinda bummed on my own. The thing is, I know when I'm in these positions I'm actually not facing anything terrible, and that whatever I choose things will be great. So why am I so paralysed with indecision? (Genuinely cannot think or make up my mind.) I know I overthink things, and that it's probably to do with lack of control. I ask other friends for advice but they swing from ""go!"" to ""don't go"" and I know they can't make this choice for me.  Does anyone else suffer from this sort of chronic panic about making a choice, even a silly one like this, and any advice for understanding it…*and hopefully overcoming it?"

I can't think my way to a decision, so I end up making rushed choices at the last minute. They don't always work out badly, but I often still worry about what I have done and wish I'd been calm, so that I could be sure of doing the 'right thing'.  I just can't seem to pack for trips any more. I used to do it all the time, years ago. Now I end up taking over my baggage allowance and forgetting important stuff.  I fantasise about how great things are going to be and then worry that I'm just building castles in the air and how I'm not the person I imagine myself to be and won't enjoy things at all. The anxiety can take a lot of the pleasure out of things.  I'm in therapy now for what has finally been diagnosed as anxiety (after detours via ADHD and bipolar disorder). The advice I have been given is that the priority is to deal with the anxiety state first.  There's an acronym STOPP, Stop what you are doing, Take a breath (several, slowly there's probably advice on here about it), Observe (yourself, the situation), Perspective (try to take a detached view of the situation), Practise what works. In my case, the last one is more breathing and then some self nurturing thinking.  Before I started therapy, I would just avoid the stuff that seemed to provoke the anxiety until it was unavoidable and I ended up with more anxiety and panic states.  The other part is that anxiety treatment is not just for times of high anxiety. I'm told that practising relaxation even when it doesn't seem necessary is beneficial.  So, no you are not alone jojeba. Yes something can be done about it, I'm told that a permanent cure is possible."

This time of year is tough for me, so I have to work much harder to manage it.  My best advice would be:  (1) Make sure you are eating well - unprocessed, nutritious foods and stay away from sugar (it gives you a high, then drops you into a low.)  People often assume that depression and fluctuating moods are caused by the brain but the majority of our mood receptors are in the gut.  (2) Spend at least three hours of your evening doing things that reduce your blood pressure and heart rate. In my case, I meditate, give myself reflexology massages to the feet, do Yoga, have a facial, soak in the bath...whatever works for you.  (3) Switch your tea and coffee to Decaffeinated.  (4) Get outside for a walk every day - even if it's only a brisk twenty minutes.  (5) Find some form of exercise that you enjoy. It relieves stress and boosts your immune system.

It sounds like you could be suffering from a condition called Social Phobia, an irrational fear of people. It’s where you have an irrational fear of people, that they are somehow judging you negatively, as if they can see your ‘weakness’. It sets off the fight or response which will make you sweat and maybe ever give a panic attack. If you search ‘Social Phobia’ on this forum scroll down and I’ve posted some articles."

Social anxiety sucks  Going at quieter times is actually an avoidance strategy that actually perpetuates the fear you have as you’re convincing the brain there is actually something to fear. This illness can be overcome by reality facing your worst fears and doing it anyway. Only by doing this will you convince the brain there really is nothing to fear from social interactions.

I understand what your saying but I’ve tried all that and it’s never got better. Working for me was really hard having to sit in an office full of people but I did it for years just wishing they’d all disappear. I even tried bar work to conquer it but I shook so much I spilt more drink than I served. I’m now in my 60s and accepted I’ll always suffer this anxiety so I do shopping when I’m able to . I still do some socialising but it isn’t a pleasure for me but if I don’t try I would become a hermit.

That’s way the anticipated anxiety level is always higher than the actual anxiety level when you get there. Therefore, the more you push through the fear, with constant repetition, the more you realise there is actually nothing to fear. The meaning of social interactions begins to change and you begin realising you are upsetting yourself for no good reason."

Anyway, it's tough to think clearly when your mind is all over the place. That's why it's best to get help. Find someone to talk to, too. Usually the things we worry about aren't even happening to us. We just deal with the paranoia. I'm sure it's all delusions. Hopefully you can find a way to get through these hard times.

I am in the process of returning to work after working at home during the covid months, it is nice to get back to some form of normality. My company has introduced security for their computers which require me to use both my phone and personal emails to give me access. Just did it and stuff it if you don’t want to use your own phone etc. While I don’t really mind this, I think it would have been nice to have been asked not told, but I am finding that I am very anti doing this and tend to dig my heals in, almost scared but worried that they are tracking me and that there is some other motive. I don’t often take my phone to work, I like to keep things separate, it helps me cope with things as I do struggle with the balance between work and life and know that in reality I am being just silly but can’t help it and do feel a bit foolish because of it.

I am really struggling at the moment, well, the last few weeks. I've had anxiety for years, but not as bad as this. Basically, my mind keeps attempting to convince me I have convicted the most heinous acts, which of course, I haven't. It festers and tries militantly to make me try to believe it. I mentioned one of the thoughts to one of my family members and whilst I adamantly said it didn't happen, they didn't quite understand. This has gone on for a few weeks now, from the moment I open my eyes, I worry about it and I don't know what to do. The main thing I worry about is rape, I am not capable of hurting anyone sexually or otherwise! But my brain keeps thinking, ""what if you did though, then what?"" It's horrible and I don't know what to do about it. Does anyone else have similar thoughts and perhaps some advice? I try to distract myself and tell myself over and over again ""it didn't happen!"" There's no actual sustenance to these delusions/thoughts. But yet, they keep coming back. I am hoping one day, I'll just forget about them and move-on. But the way things are going, I don't know. I have arranged to see my psychiatrist again next week and I'll try to ask him what he thinks. Hopefully he can put me on meds just to calm me down a while. I gave-up drinking again, which kind of helps. But I keep thinking maybe a few drinks will stop it, but I know that's not the case...Anyway that's a different story. Many thanks. For reading."

It's good that you have an appointment booked and hopefully can get some help to deal with them.  I suppose it could be linked with the stopping drinking, or some added stress that you might be dealing with? My thoughts kick into gear when I'm under immense stress or pressure. They can last a day to a few weeks but they always pass. Mindfulness can be really helpful when they happen. It might be worth looking into that while you wait for your appointment."

I'll try to keep this discreet and succinct.  Around five years ago I moved to a new area, well away from family and friends. Within a few weeks I'd befriended some neighbours - a couple and their lodger - who were welcoming, lovely and generous. It was nice to have friends and it helped me settle in.  Around 18 months ago, the couple announced they were to marry and asked me to be a part of the ceremony. This included organising a weekend away with one of them and other associated friends.  It was quite complicated to organise and there were some tense moments - at the same time I was purchasing my first home in the same area and arranging the transition from rented accommodation. The couple felt I wasn't dedicating enough time to their special day/plans and in truth I was struggling with the expense.  The weekend away did eventually happen and a lot of alcohol was consumed. To be brief and frank, I was awoken from sleep the first night to find that our betrothed friend had got into bed with me, removed my underwear and was attempting to perform a sex act on me. I forced the person away and managed to get through the rest of the time, though it was difficult.  On return I spent a fitful few days wondering what to do and eventually confronted the friend and said I felt I could not be part of the wedding and wanted to be left alone. I was removed from all groups/social media etc. and erased from their lives.  That leads me to now, a year on. The three of them are still very local and I see them often - high street, shops, bar etc. There's no acknowledgement although accidentally eye contact is made. I find it hard - it actually causes a rush of panic/adrenaline and I'm obviously stuck in the area as I bought a home here believing I had friends.  Has anyone else had something similar, and if so how have you learned to cope?  I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Thank you, from a forum newbie."

Try to distract yourself. A good distraction would be a serious conversation. Try doing that and pay attention after the conversation ends, you’ll find that you were ok. The problem starts when you focus on yourself and breathing.  As for vaping, do you read the label to know the mix of what you’re breathing into your lungs? Stay away from e-liquids that use oil based flavors. I mix my own at home ? to be on the safe side(not sure if that’s considered being on the safe side?)  I doubt that it’s the vaping. You were concerned about and focused on your breathing.  Are you having enough sleep? Lack of sleep makes your chest feels heavy sometimes.  I hope you feel better soon."

A month and a half ago someone I know (a close friend's cousin) died so suddenly of Acute Leukemia at the age of 22. It sent me into a massive shock and then health anxiety took over and has been with me since.  I am an accountant and have two exams to take in December, I had left my job because the stress of the job meant I kept failing my exams. But now I am battling exam stress and the health anxiety at the same time. Worried the same thing could happen to me, I could get blood cancer out of the blue and die suddenly. What exactly brought on my health anxiety was googling online at what Leukemia was - I always thought of cancer as a slow progressing illness and didn't understand how someone could die unexpectedly like that. The more I googled the more the anxiety took over and before you know it, I was in a vicious cycle.  I decided to seek professional help, I went to someone who specialises in CBT around OCD and health anxiety and they decided to put me on a programme which involved exposure therapy. I was seeing him for 5 weeks and then I stopped as it was getting worse for me. We had agreed to 'hold off' the therapy until my exams were done. Exposure therapy is an extremely difficult task to undertake and I couldn't do it alongside the task of studying for two very big papers. It made everything 100 times worse for me, my anxiety was the worst its ever been and a few days ago I almost had a panic attack. My family are also away for a month and so I have no distractions and no one to talk to except be stuck alone with my studying. It was all making it worse for me. By the end of it I found other ways of seeking reassurance i.e. checking my body, and also avoiding certain chemicals like a plague, which cause cancer.  I guess my question is has anyone who deals with anxiety and phobia had exposure therapy before? I have never had this type of therapy before and I really struggled to carry out the exercises. I was terrified whenever it was time to do an exposure exercise, and scientifically this is supposed to help your health anxiety but it only made it worse. If you aren't anxious enough then the exercise isn't working and if you get too terrified then you go the other way and your anxiety goes over the roof!!!  I would be keen to know about any one else out there who has had this type of therapy and whether it has worked for them? What did they do right? I really want to work with my therapist to combat this but whenever I do the exposure work it just makes my health anxiety worse!!  Any help and advice on this would be much appreciated."

I think you have been made to feel mortal and that comes as as shock to us all at times in our lives. When both my parents died I suddenly felt my stomach drop as I am now the next generation and it could happen to me next.  I have only read about exposure therapy so know little about it but I understand that it makes the process get worse before it gets better. I would say that you are bound to suffer some anxiety as that is the nature of your problem. But maybe he was rushing you on in the stages too quickly so you didn't have time to adjust to one problem overcome before he loaded another on top of that. It might be an idea to talk to him about slowing the process down for you.  All the best with the exams. I see your name is Mindfull so perhaps compartmentalise your anxiety and concentrate on your exams as well as you can. Could it be worse because of the stress of your exams? Its like we sometimes distract from one anxiety to another to hide the fear aroused by the first one.

People have passed away before, I have been to funerals of my grandparents etc but never felt like this. Once I heard the news it was like a switch that went off - it was a massive shock as he was so young, I still can't believe it. I can only imagine how his family are dealing with it all.  calypso said: but I understand that it makes the process get worse before it gets better. Yes I was hoping this was the case as I was feeling like nothing he (my therapist) was recommending was working for me. I 100% agree that I felt he was throwing me into the deep end a little bit and I don't think I was prepared enough for it. I didn't even understand my anxiety - I am on at the beginning stages of understanding it now and I have a lot of work to do. I think I will need to talk to him to get him to slow down a little bit and break down the ERP work to smaller manageable chunks. Then when I got a bit more of a footing we can pick up the pace a little perhaps.  calypso said: Could it be worse because of the stress of your exams? Its like we sometimes distract from one anxiety to another to hide the fear aroused by the first one.  Once again you have hit the nail on the head - I notice I have scary thoughts when I am studying as that is when my mind tends to wonder the most - the exam stress adds fuel to the fire and further aggravates the health anxiety in fact its also the other way around - like ping pong. Completely agree that the health anxiety is used to escape from the exam stress.  All in all its all just so horrible, I cannot wait until my exam is over in 4 weeks. I wonder what how my health anxiety will play out after the exam...but at the point I think I will be in a better position to carry out the ERP work my therapist recommends?  Thank you for your response and your wishes on passing my exams!"

Are you still trying exposure therapy? I have emetophobia (extreme case) and did try exposure therapy a couple of years ago. We first tried listening to people getting sick and then tried to watch videos of people getting sick for different reasons (food, alcohol, stomach bug) but it totally put me over the edge. As much as I want to get over this phobia - I couldn't bring myself to continue with the exposure therapy. It was just too much for me to handle. I hope, if you are still suffering and trying the exposure therapy, that it is helping you."

I keep going back to my perceived mistakes, down to the smallest detail, thinking how I have done things wrong, thinking about them over and over, believing they are going to adversely affect my life now and in the future. I get worried all the time that I will get into trouble, that I keep making mistakes without realising. I just have this constant fear of mistakes and I keep thinking of the worst case scenario. And this haunts me to the core. I used to be able to rationalise most things, not over think things, accept that sometimes people make genuine mistakes and slips up but that’s okay that is part of life. Not anymore.

Strangers grossed me out. I didn't want to be bothered by them and I still sort of feel like they can see my thoughts. It's partly ridiculous and it's been going on at least a month.

(smoking normal tobacco) I've smoked since I was 13 I'm now nearly 28. I've tried so hard to give up and this sounds completely insane but it's my little 5 min break.. to some extent I enjoy it. But recently I've found that I'm getting my anxiety symptoms back my belly is so nauseous,headaches, feeling more tired. Has anyone else had this with smoking?? I'm so scared that if I don't have my 5 min getaway my anxiety will be so much worse. When in actual fact the smoking is probably what's causing it. Has anyone else quit while having anxiety??. What helped you give up? Any tips you can give me?? I really want to give up I just need some help!!!..."

3952,Anxiety Forum,185815,Horrible letter from housing,2018-08-14T14:45:08+0100,author,True,64870,London UK,American Boy,I just got a horrible letter from my housing office saying that they have set up a meeting which is next week to discuss my tenancy and that a tenancy check will be carried out on my property by some people from the council and the housing officer will be attending along with the tenancy officer... Now I'm shitting myself what it could all be about  I don't have any rent arrears I don't owe any council tax and I don't play any music or have the TV on without headphones I make minimal noise such as walking about or doing the washing up etc etc.  There are no smells coming from my house so I can't think what else it could be about.  I think somebody has been making false complaints about me because people seem to hate me without me even doing anything or even saying anything to them.  I have a secure tenancy and I have never been in trouble before with the housing department.  I have phoned them up but my housing officer is not willing to discuss anything until the meeting.  I've been living in my flat since 2008 I have a feeling that they are going to tell me that I have breached my tenancy and that it has been terminated I have no idea why but I have a gut feeling that somebody has gone out of there way to get me evicted.  Last August around the same time a meeting was called about my support and I was told that I will no longer get support and I lost my support workers due to cuts to the services.  Now its August again and I'm probably going to be told that I've done something wrong and that my secure tenancy will be terminated leaving me homeless and I'd have no other option to end my life because I would have lost everything after that.  I have spent a lot of money on my flat getting it the way I want it and its all I have.

I am in a privately rented property and we have regular inspections to check the condition of the property, used to be 3 monthly, now less often as they have realised we aren't trashing it (a previous tenant did).  Even if it is regarding a complaint, it is very difficult to get someone evicted (especially if they are considered vulnerable and the council have a duty to provide housing - this may apply to you Rethink have useful info on this and their helpline may be useful too.) We had a neighbour who was a nightmare, constantly breached noise orders and his property was filthy (think layer of black grime on every surface and awful smell) and they told us he couldn't be evicted due to vulnerability.  I know it's easy to say, but there may not be anything to worry about so just focus on the property being clean and tidy when they come to show things at their best."

I have a nice country kitchen which I paid a lot of money doing it up and spent a lot of man hours on it. They said they would write it off as being done.  I have a nice Victorian bathroom there is nothing wrong with anything and the bath and sink are perfect with perfect enamel and I have nice old Victorian gold taps and Victorian patterned tiles. They said they would not change it because nothing needed to be replaced.  I remember they came around with a catalog showing the kinda kitchens and bathrooms they were fitting and they all looked cheap and nasty plain and boring with the cheapest possible units and cheap mixer taps and plain white tiles.  They also cut corners and bodge stuff and at the end of the day they don't give a shit what your house looks like after just as long as they have fitted in the rubbish they were told to and that they get paid.

So sorry they upset you Daisy  Really it should be protected by English Heritage but I don't think the property qualifies for that.  back in 2013 the central heating was upgraded... well more like down graded.  They cut corners they had to take some doors off to fit new pipe work and the they left the doors off so I had to put them back on again and the doors are very heavy old oak I hope they don't plan on ripping those out and replacing them with those cheap white hollow cardboard and plywood doors that's another fear I have. Its really stupid what they do its like tear out something that some people would pay an arm and a leg for and spend money on replacing it with something cheap and nasty.  Anyway back to the pluming... to cut it a long story short... all the pipe work they did is surface mounted because the council are to cheap to do things nicely. Its ruined the look of my nice Victorian hallway as the exposed surface mount pipe work is a distraction and an eye sore. I have got used to looking at it but other people always notice it and comment.  They were very sloppy when they fitted one of the new radiators. The old radiator was centered in the middle of the kitchen wall. When they fitted the new radiator they just plonked it towards the end of the wall lazily to save pipe and it looked awful I got fed up with looking at it and luckily at the time I had an advocate who also saw it and she agreed that it looks lazy and she made the council put it right by refitting the radiator the where the original one was fitted.  I dread to think what they do in regards to the electrics it be all surface mount wiring ""warehouse style"" my nice living room will be uglyfied.  The place already had new wiring put in back in 2009 and I get a visit from an electrician once a year who checks everything. I also used to be an electrician and that wiring is still new but they want to replace it all just for the sake of doing so."

I, too, am a tenant of a social landlord and they keep reminding me it is a clause in my tenancy agreement that I allow them access for an inspection - to let them see I am taking care of the flat, washing the windows, etc. I have been in this flat since December 2005 and every year I get a letter saying she wants access to inspect the property, setting a date and time, and every year she does not turn up.  My home came with a care package when I first took on the tenancy, which comprised of a welfare check - someone coming to my door every morning after 10am to make sure I was okay. I was in full-time work at the time, so was never in when they came. But come they did, every morning, and would phone the police to ask them to force access because I wouldn't answer the door. Total farce. The police, thankfully, had a little more common sense and would phone me to check up on me.  Hopefully it is just an annual inspection.

There not just trying to make the communal areas look hostel like but they are now extending it into peoples homes fitting cheap nasty plain kitchens and bathrooms most of which don't need doing I understand that there are other flats that do nned it.  They seem to be spending thousands ripping out perfectly good fixtures and uglyfiying period properties with there cheap rubbish. I used to have good decent locks on my front door but they took them off and fitted cheap nasty locks which one of them had to be redone soon after as it broke and I don't particularly feel safe with the bodged handy work that was done, they did all the council properties... but yet they wont spend a few extra quid on fitting decent things or leaving things alone that don't need to be done.  They don't care about peoples safety, they only care about what they can do to avoid being sued.  The Grenfell fire is an excuse for councils to carry out unnecessary work. Yes the Grenfell tower had bad cladding and fire doors failed the fire test but that is a good example of how these councils cut corners and bodge stuff to save money, they will never learn.  The government are trying to get rid of social housing so all those half assed renovations are just to get council properties ready for sale while in the mean time rules are being tightened to the point tenants are more likely to fail to keep within the terms and conditions of there tenancy, they be telling people next that there not allowed to paint the walls or there will be rules on how many items they can have in there flat with constant interrogation meetings and inspections carried monthly I wouldn't be supersized if they started telling people how they should live or start taking measurements of rooms to ensure that nice spacious are sold and the remaining ones are kept at minimal size to the point where people are only allowed to live in a tiny bedsit rather than a one bedroom flat.

3987,Anxiety Forum,322585,Question for women,2020-10-07T09:58:33+0100,author,True,92994,london,WanderingA,Does anyone else get really bad periods when anxiety hits?. Since I had my first child 8 years ago my periods were really irregular sometimes I'd go 6 months without one and it was light and lasted 3/5days max. But the last 3 months they've been really bad really heavy and so painful lasting over a week and sometimes having 2 in one month. I'm wondering if this is a stress/anxiety thing. I have been more stressed since the kids being bk to school. Has anyone else had this?

Myself always had irregular periods before but it was caused by the thyroid.  I’m just thinking that it have changed and also become more painful, it’s something that need to be checked out by a professional. Just to make sure it’s nothing else causing your problems.  But stress can make the period get a bit changed. The times I stress a lot it can make my period become irregular again until I go back to normal level of stress."

Mindfulness meditation typically involves working with something known as an object, or anchor of attention—a neutral reference point that helps support mental stability. An anchor might be the sensation of our breath coming in and out of the nostrils, or the rising and falling of our abdomen. When we become lost in thought during practice, we can return to our anchor, fixing our attention on the stimuli we’ve chosen.  But anchors can also intensify trauma. The breath, for instance, is far from neutral for many survivors. It’s an area of the body that can hold tension related to a trauma and connect to overwhelming, life-threatening events.  As a remedy, we can encourage survivors to offer people different anchors of attention. Each person’s anchor will vary: for some, it could be the sensations of their hands resting on their thighs, or their buttocks on the cushion. Other stabilizing anchors might include another sense all together, such as hearing or sight.  Anchors of attention you can offer students and clients practicing mindfulness—besides the sensation of the breath in the abdomen or nostrils—include different physical sensations (feet, buttocks, back, hands) and other senses (seeing, smelling, hearing). One client of mine had a soft blanket that she would touch slowly as an anchor. Another used a candle. For some, walking meditation is a great way to develop more stable anchors of attention, such as the feeling of one’s feet on the ground—whatever supports self-self-regulation and stability. Experimentation is key. Click to expand...  Source: What’s Trauma-Sensitive Mindfulness?"

Sometimes feeling slightly anxious about the state of the world right now but you have to remember that it's always been a crazy place and in some ways life is getting better for the average person - life expectancy etc.  Mostly looking forward to autumn now, it gives me an opportunity to tidy the garden because it looks a bit messy by late summer and it's nice to watch tv on a dark evening with the lamps on etc, Click to expand... Heyy. I'm glad your doing ok!. Ah no I used to have fish but unfortunately they died and I didn't get more now my kids are growing up Im thinking it may be a great pet to have for them to look after. We already have a cat but he's very old now. Yes I too get anxious about the world were living in its true that it's always been a scary place but I think since the pandemic it's made everyone realise how scary it can be.. oh I also love autumn and winter. I get very hot very quickly so for me colder weather is when I feel alot less anxious. I'm currently trying to wallpaper this should be fun. Ha. I'm going for navy and grey colours in my lounge gives me a lovely cosy vibe. X"

I was slowly burning out from my full time job and was taking a bit of time off here and there and I was having really bad negative thoughts and I wish I just stuck at work and didn't have time off. I think I had a burn out and I was getting fed up in general. Then my Mum had a accident, she fell down on a ramp and then it all triggered from there! I had really bad OCD and intrusive thoughts for months and months. I was on St Johns Wort for 4 months then came off it due to seratonin syndrome. After 2 months I took 1 pill which was a ssri pill and I had chemical reactions in my brain, it affected my head badly. So I waited for that to come out of my system. I have been having on going CBT help through the NHS which was good, I only had 6 sessions with my therapist. Had another therapist and he made me feel worse.  So to cut a long story short. I refuse to take any SSRI medication for my symptoms and I now take Organic Ashwagandha powder, I take 1/2 a teaspoon and put it into my porridge and it instantly works straight away. I am thin in weight, so my body absorbs it very quickly.  So my racing and overwhelmed thoughts are suddenly put to ease and I am instantly relaxed and I find I can power through the day without having to think too much. Where as if I don't take it, I am over thinking constantly and repeating stuff in my mind and then my day is just slow as ever.  So I take every morning, Omega 3-9 vegan supplements, Vitamin D spray and Ashwagandha supplement powder. I have to say it is a god send. I find it does the job if you want to keep busy to stop your mind racing around and spiraling out of control. I have also stopped drinking alcohol as that can have an affect on my health and I am going to cut my sugar intake. Even though I take it at times I will still suffer from relaxation and I think it's because of the anxiety from the trauma I had back in 2009.  My question for you is, what do you take to calm your mind?"

No, I don't believe they work better than the drugs a doctor can prescribe, the Graviola was only 80% effective compared to a big pharma brand anti-psychotic which is closer to 95%. And those numbers are based on the volume of the voice that I hear and the amount of pain it could cause me.  The upside was the Graviola didn't have any side effects or at least none that I could tell without having blood tests done, there was no sedating effect or increased appetite/weight gain during the 43 days of taking them.

I’m on mirtazipine duloxitine lorazepam and propanalol for depression and anxiety.

I see a lot of sadness in my job, much trauma, bullying, depression, delusional beliefs, violence, etc. I have a rather humane and probably humanistic outlook. As a result the failings of the system, or shit stem as Peter Tosh would have called it, hurt. Imagine my feelings when, after a few desultory sessions to talk about dealing with my manager in 2015, the counsellor said bye and pounded upstairs to the room above, and told a colleague, audible to me below, 'yes another one completed. Yaayy.' Human, yes. Pathetic, yes."

Some of them act like babies and do things like this. It's best not to let them know what you're doing...even when the other therapy starts. Don't let them dictate things...remember it's YOU'RE life and do what you think is good for you.  There's not much you can do with her gone now but wait for the other therapy to start. Where you live it would probably take a long time to get a new talk therapist. But now you know what to do for the next time: don't tell them everything.

Its really hard not to think horrible things when my gut instinct is telling me that it happened. I nearly exploded and was ready to to make a phone call to somebody but I stopped myself, and now it keeps playing over in my mind what could of happened and then I go back on my gut instinct again and the thoughts play over and over in my mind.

I would advocate a book called, ""Emotional Hijacking"" by Marlene Schneider Potter, which is written VERY simply and even has larger type face. She realises that people in an emotional crisis, whatever the cause, find reading text difficult. Its got accurate explanation of what is happening to you, and why, and then some simple exercises to help you get on top of the worst of the experiences. My daughter nicked my copy immediately, she said it was brilliant. (I want it back!)."

So I've had severe anxiety ever since I can remember, but it massively improved over the last couple of years after having CBT, a job I was comfortable in, good exercise / healthy eating, enough sleep etc.  3 weeks ago I started a new job. I took the job because it was an opportunity that I'll probably never see again, good money, a big company in the industry I've always wanted to work in, and there were over 100 applicants for my position. So far, I have hated every second of it.  I'm constantly exhausted, I keep messing up and making stupid mistakes when the stakes are high and there are no room for errors, my colleagues are not my kind of people at all, the workload is unmanageable, my role doesn't match the job description and I can't stand my manager. I've cried in the toilets nearly every day and I'm smoking nearly a pack of cigarettes a day which I've never done before. I go to work in the dark, sit in an office all day and then go home in the dark. I spend every weekend dreading the following Monday. I'm even trying to source generic amphetamine and ADHD meds online to make my days feel less horrifying.  I feel trapped. I can't quit because I'll be letting myself and my family down (this opportunity won't come again) and I don't have a plan B or any other source of income, but I feel so unhappy, useless and unmotivated. I'm eating nothing during the day and microwave food at night, and it's like my mental health has just completely spiralled again and I'm back to square one.  The thought of staying at this job for at least another 6 months to a year (without break because probation) actually makes me feel physically nauseous. Honestly the thought of another week there makes me want to cry. I have no idea what to do. I feel so ungrateful and stupid.  Does anyone else struggle with job/careers while dealing with anxiety or other mental health issues?"

Here is a list of of things that can be happening. -U feel inferior to other people.For example If someone is more verbal than u than they will make u feel like your stupid and it will cause anxiety especially if its your boss. If your boss is taller, with an authoritive voice more mature looking it will cause anxiety. Or if your visual and your boss is verball it will cause anxiety...bottom line when someone presents themself to be smarter than u it will cause anxiety. Dont be inferior to nobody. If your iq is over 25 or 50 you are smart just u need to figure out why your iq is low.in other words figure out where your brain works properly and where it doesnt...then focus on your strengths and MOST of your weaknesses will disapear. -IF U HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS...WHICH IM SURE U DO TO SOME DEGREE OTHER WISE U WOULDNT BE IN THIS MESS( I SPEAK FROM A LOVING HEART) IM KINDA REPEATING WHAT I ALREADY SAID BECAUSE U MAKING MISTAKES IS FROM YOUR INSECURITIES AND YOU FEELING INSECURITIES TO SOMEONE ELSE. -FIGURE OUT OUT VISUAL AND HOW VERBAL U ARE. THESE 2 ARE THE KEYS TO INTELLIGENCE. IF U BECOME INTELLIGENT YOUR MENTAL ANXIETY WILL GO AWAY. - IQ IS A GENERALISED TEST THAT SHOWS HOW SMART THEY ARE...KEY WORD GENERALIZED...YOU CAN BE VERY VISUAL BUT NOT AT ALL VERBAL AND IT WILL BRING YOUR IQ SCORE DOWN THERFORE IQ IS NOT THE DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE -if u have a poor memory it will bring uour iq down. If u have a slow processing speed it will bring your iq down. But the real answer to what intelligence is...is how your brain procesess information Education is also not the answere to inteligence ...education is just learning information...obtaining knowledge.....once u get knowledge your brain must prioritize it correctly and find use for it. That is intelligence. Intelligence is not knowledge like most people think. Intelligence takes experience,exploring,observing, luck, seeing different things, hearing, listening,revalation ect....than your brain must prioritize and find use for information ---im suspecting u may be somewhat visual so u get touched when someone makes facial reactions. And u might be a better visually when its upclose..meaning if someone is making facial expresions upclose it will cause your mood to change ----also your brain comprehend better up close...meaning if someone if someone is screaming from far away thsn your mood wont change but if they do it to your face tthan it will hurt u. ----u might have spiritual problems which c as n bd triggured for many reasons like games tv phones and so forth but im not gonna get into the spritual problems By the way i had 14 jobs in 5 years. I learned the hard way dont chase money ---there is much more but these are some of the main ones"

I woke up at 6am randomly and already started crying knowing that I have to get through another day. I’m trying to be strong, I wiped away my tears and told myself I can do this, I can get up, and ignore the thoughts in my head. I tried reading but started crying and feeling anxious again.  Now I’m just sitting here feeling like I want to selfharm again. I’m alone, mum is at work which in my current crisis and mental state these past few months makes it worse. I noticed I’m stronger and a bit more joyful when I have her in my company.  My anxiety is rising by the hour, my ocd triggered it again over a certain obsession and fear that I have, I keep having what if thoughts as usual, and I’m so depressed. I keep having the compulsion to check and obsess and worry and panic, but the meds are slightly working and my anxiety and panic isn’t rising as strongly as usual. I cant stop crying though. And feeling guilty and like a bad person because I have nothing to be sad about. My arms and legs work, I have a roof over my head, food, opportunities. Why am I like this. It makes me so disappointed in myself and hate myself.  There isn’t any advice I haven’t heard before, Im just posting this because…I don’t know I guess I feel so alone in my head. I know there’s nothing anyone can do.. I’m crying again now and debating whether to get the razor blade. I’m tired of being alive and I’m only 24. My mind is too much.  I wasn’t supposed to be like this. I’m tired of fighting. I’m tired of just surviving and counting down the hours of everyday, only to have another day come and repeat over and over again. I just want to feel normal..peaceful."

Oh sweetheart, I’m so sorry. Definitely go out into your garden. Are there any plants / flowers/ trees there? Do you have grass or a lawn? If you can, take your shoes off and concentrate on the feeling of the earth under your feet. Take some deep breaths. I’m suggesting these things to try and distract you- maybe they sound silly but what have you got to lose?  Even though your mum got angry, it probably is more utter fear that is manifesting itself in anger. I bet she loves you and is desperate for a way to help you. She is probably at a complete loss at how she can help and I bet she’s terrified - you are her precious daughter. When she gets home, can you give her a hug? I bet you both could do with one.  Try to show yourself some compassion. You are not weak. It sounds like you have an illness and are doing your best under the circumstances. Please don’t give up. It’s late at night here so I’ll probably fall asleep soon. Will check in again tomorrow. Stay safe. X"

They would just come into my house for less than 5 mins, check I was ok and leave. Rubbish. Obviously I’m going to have ok days but it doesn’t mean I’m not in need of help.

Besides, don’t you care how mum will feel without you? It hurts your loved ones more than it hurts you. Did you think about seeing your Dr.? They can give you something to ease your thoughts. A therapist will help too but it takes a while. I was getting severe panic attacks and had no idea what I was afraid of. If you know what you fear that causes this, then this is the first place to start. One step at a time. Little steps at a time. You will overcome this. Without meds it takes much longer. These attacks are a form of protection that your body puts out. It can’t harm you. Some people have claimed they have great results going on you tube and doing a meditation session."

I am an introverted person, I can't stand parties/ big events and I don't drink which is difficult as that is the norm for people my age and when I attend a party, wedding or big event I feel really panicked and usually want to escape the situation very quickly, for example I attended a party not so long ago and was insistent on leaving and kept going to the toilet to calm down, and when I did return home I had a panic attack. This factor then stems to when it is my birthday and especially key birthdays such as my eighteenth, twenty first and I feel consistently anxious about these times instead of excited. I think what doesn't help these situations as well is that I am consistently comparing myself to others my age.  Also, I am still living at home with my parents and siblings and we have recently been told that our house that we are selling, and which I have struggled to come to terms with has been sold which has made me really upset and anxious as I have been so used to my house and I am comfortable in my environment, however I understand I cannot stay at home with my parents for the rest of my life . Our move isn't even local and is a couple of hours away so I leave behind my friends and my work which surprisingly is one of the things keeping me going especially during the pandemic, and some local activities I attend.The thought of getting used to a new area, and people scares me so much and I have always been someone who has a small selection of friends but I always observe the type of people I associate with and this usually works in my favour as I have some really long lasting friendships, but a lot of my friends are similar to me and quite shy and quiet. My biggest fear is there response when I tell them I am moving.  Lastly, currently we have been through a pandemic which I have suffered quite badly with. Before I resumed work I was furloughed for a good couple of months as was a lot of others. The first couple of weeks didn't faze me and I was actually quite content with being at home, however the last couple of weeks before I returned to worked I formed quite high levels of depression. I was secluding myself from my family and didn't really know why, I was not eating as much, I was afraid of leaving the house because of the pandemic, my skin was getting worse . One day then came round and I just broke down, but I broke down to my family about my issues and this really helped and then I was getting better day by day. Until the move really, which has caused a setback.  Hopefully there are people who can relate to some of the situations and provide me with some support  Thank You"

I spent my 20s saying to my mum that i 'should' be doing that or 'should' be going there. My mum said that i should just do what i want to do.  I was then on holiday mid 20s and was talking to a similar aged girl on the beach. She described herself as a 'homebod' and i thought that was great because i am that too.

I know there's things I can do to prevent the silly thoughts / barriers in my head ... Basically, I'd love some advice before (if needed) burdening our health service!!   Thanks in advance!"

I don't know from your post if this anxiety's an uncomfortable feeling or panicking event. Just by what you've said, it might stem from bringing someone into your world of drugs/alcohol. (Unsure of the drug/s or frequency you refer to)  'Sharing' our lives brings with it a host of variables. Sexual intimacy has the capacity to move onto emotional intimacy. For some this eludes to 'danger' and/or 'accountability', a situation some veer from fearing their lives will change, especially those who're emotionally inclined or hard-core bachelors/bachelorettes.  Not sure how old you are either. I'm assuming you're young?"

I haven't done anything wrong or have reason to believe that they were coming after me but at the same time I thought oh shit my life is over and I was in my PJ's and started thinking that what if they try take me in my PJ's and all sorts was going through my mind and things went quiet and then I started thinking that they were planing something like they they were gonna shoot me or something and then I calmed down later afterwards. It turns out that they were there for somebody else. Thats the second panic attack I had today.  Things are getting worse with my mental state.

Oh, before I start I'd like to say I have tried to get therapy, I've been waiting for help from the NHS ALL year, but I'm having my first session with a private therapist next week! I was in a really bad place when I was 13, a family member had just died and I was increasingly getting more depressed and began self harming. I got a boyfriend (he was 15) who cheated on me the first two months we were together, broke up with me, and then said the other girl was better. I was so naive back then I thought we were going to be together forever so I stupidly took him back when he said he wanted me again. To keep him I felt like I had to do something sexual or he wouldn't 'love' me enough, at times he forced me to do things, saying it was kinky. I thought it was good but it was so scary, it made me cry every single time. He did this every time we were together, we couldn't even watch TV without him starting something. I had to deal with this for two years, during that time I became twisted, I was horrible and mean to the people that were close to me. But I did break up with my boyfriend, eventually after months of threatening to kill himself he did leave alone. I was fine until I was 16 but then I started sixth form, my parents got divorced and my mum found someone else, it all became too much for me and I just broke down. I've been agoraphobic since then (I'm 18 now). I get anxious about literally everything. I find it so hard to have sex with my boyfriend (who is an angel!), I feel numb, it makes me cry nearly every time. I feel disorientated from the whole world afterwards and I say horrible things to him, I don't know why. Could my first boyfriend have caused all this? It only started bothering me this year, I only actually acknowledged that I was sexually abused a couple of months ago. Help!"

It could be your first boyfriend caused this.Maybe get in touch with rape crisis they deal with all kinds of sexual abuse not just rape and they may offer counselling.Nikitax

It might have something to do with your ex but of course we aren't experts so can't say for sure and it's great that you are starting therapy soon, hopefully that will help you figure some things out.  I was abused by my brother many years ago and I regressed it for many years and finally acknowledged it about a year ago myself.

I'm hoping by putting this down I'll get others who are in the same boat and people can say nothing is seriously wrong with me!   I‘m a 31 year old male, slightly overweight but generally ok (I hop  On 29th Feb 2029 I was sick (throwing up) on a Saturday evening - through the nose and mouth. This was after a day drinking and eating fatty food. The next day I was fine until late afternoon when I started to get a tension/pressure headache across my temples. I didn't worry too much and thought it would go by the next day. I've had this type of headache before, brain tumour worries before (about 6 years ago) and I got through it. Next day I woke up and it hadn't gone. It was a dull band type feeling, mainly on my temples and front of face around nose and eye sockets.  This hasn't gone at all over these past 4 weeks - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A nose feels a little stuffy but I've had a sinus infection before and it doesn't feel 100% like that. Last few days I've started to worry about my vision - blury/unfocused eyes when looking at something for a period of time, especially at a TV or PC, and it clears when a blink. I also have a slight sensitivity to bright light like the sun and eyes feel sore.  I have also started to get a strange feeling in the right side of my face and body - not numb but like a weird tingle type feeling, mainly between my ear and jaw (cheek area). My ears have started to have the odd sharp pain. Headaches have been consistent with the odd pain or blocked feeling. I can exercise as normal, I don't have any balance etc issues or speech. The headache does seem to be worse in the morning (more pressure) when I wake up buy ok when laying down. I do feel more pressure, especially above the nose and around it when bending over. I've also had some muscle twitching which I've had before with MND/ALS fears.  I've been (obviously) googling a lot, trying to get any answer that I'm ok. Due to the lockdown I'm unable to see a GP or get my vision tested (though I did have it tested about a month ago and nothing major came up - they took photo of eye and did pressure test a well).  Is this anything to be seriously concerned about? My main worry is Brain tumour which makes me very anxious so anything that helps put my mind to rest on that front (why it isn’t) would be great. I keep trying to think I wouldn’t get all of these symptoms so quickly and at the same time.  Anyone in the same boat or has had this type of thing before that can give me some advice/support that will help? Thanks as always forum!"

We are supposed to rink two litres of water per day . Personally i think thats a lot but try increasing your water intake and see if that helps.

I feel a lot of pressure when i bend over around my eyes and nose, especially when stretching. I also have and had for 1-2 years occasional muscle twitching (fasciculations).   ""I've been (obviously) googling a lot, trying to get any answer that I'm ok. Due to the lockdown I'm unable to see a GP or get my vision tested""  -I have also been googling a lot, seeking reassurance. Similarly, wouldn't date step inside a hospital right now.   -Different from you, I've felt like I had poorer balance, strength (especially at one side) and ability to focus, though the people around me assure me that this is not true. Also different from your experience, I had a few panic attacks where I thought that I had a bulge in my neck and one where I thought I was in the middle of a stroke. I've also had attacks related to swollen hands/arms in the last month. In summary, a strong relapse into health anxiety after months of peace.  -While I do not know what is wrong with me either (apart from health anxiety, of course), I thought I could share the contents of my worries to show at least how similar symptoms could prompt different fears, and that our fears are limited to our imagination and background knowledge. This -though not a diagnosis- helps me with my worries. I had health anxiety related to my heart 1.5 years ago, which was the start for me.(By the way, I am 20, male, normal weight, had a bazillion tests done for check-up just 9 months ago)  These three weeks, I thought I had congestive heart failure - but ER visits ruled it out. I thought I had a blood clot- blood tests said no. I thought I was having a stroke, 3 days ago. I am still here without a fever/loss of vision/vomiting/any serious symptom. I know I don't have MS because I was tested for it. I currently jump between fear of a brain tumor, ALS, another neurodegenerative disease, an autoimmune disease, heart attacks, lymphoma, another slowly developing muscular disease, and more. I fully share your fear:"" I keep trying to think I wouldn’t get all of these symptoms so quickly and at the same time."" Hence I logged in to this forum, too. But when I feel good, all disappear; or I feel good when they disappear for a few hours a day."

I get dizzy spells I've just completely had enough now.. anything to do with my head always makes my anxiety come back and now it's back I just cannot cope. I got myself into a great place I started to control my anxiety attacks but now I can't think straight I cannot control them and have this awful feeling something is wrong with me. I've had blood tests not that long ago and everything was fine. It's only since stopping smoking. I knew there would be some withdrawal but not for this long! It's now starting to affect my everyday life again and I just cannot go back to how I was I just can't..

I was indulging in my loss of control and my crisis, and it scared me.  I freak myself out a lot, I am not good at handling stress and negative thoughts, but today was really bad. I became so irrational and crazy and almost could not get out of that state. I even self-harmed, and then that made me cry afterwards, because how could I do that to myself. I felt like I couldn't handle anything anymore. And yes I am hard on myself. And I was thinking how its not fair that everyone else is happy and I get like THIS. It was unbearable. I was just finding it so hard to be happy, and felt so guilty for not being able to be positive. I felt so bad. But it was like I lost my sanity. I'm a bit worried. There is something inside that wants to ruin everything, I guess we all have it but what do you do about it?  This episode of anguish and distress really weakened me. This sickening awful anxiety is creeping back. I feel really fragile. Luckily I had a tai-chi class which really re-balanced me a lot. But I am scared that depression will come back again. Last time I had it, it was just too horrible to describe.  I called a therapist referral centre and they are going to make me fill in this form and find me someone as soon as they can, which is great. I feel like I am struggling a lot at the moment, with occasional bouts of normalcy too, at least. And this whole new years resolution thing was a lot of pressure on me. I am in my final year and need to think what to do next in life. I have semi-formed plans in my head. But my mind isn't clear. I have also split up with someone recently and am still trying to get over it. I still have so much anger and pain. Last year was a living hell.  I have been anxious since childhood, exacerbated from ages 12-14. I can also be a laughing, happy, optimistic person (not just anxious, sensitive etc) but nowadays I feel I am nearing the brink again. I am very scared of how I felt today. I do not want to get worse. I felt hopeless and nearly suicidal. I don't want to go through that, life is too amazing and precious.  What do you guys do when you feel like this?"

I have struggled so with all these emotions you describe. I know the pain of what you are saying. However, I have found some good answers. There are 2 things I do when I start freaking out, which ALWAYS helps me. First, I am I believer in Jesus Christ and I know He cares for the broken ones and the little ones (like me), and He can help me when I ask. I pray and a lot of times I write my prayers to Him down on paper and I tell him all my crazy thoughts. It calms me down to write and to see my thoughts on paper. It helps me to see that I am getting irrational and need to get adjusted.  After that, I ask for His thoughts about each thing. They are found in the Bible and are totally different and wonderful. Then I cancel and cross out each of my negative thoughts and write the truth beside each one, and decide to believe that instead of my own thoughts. (Some people call this for CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). This is the way I give myself immediate therapy, anyway.  Yes, there is a dark side to each one of us that will destroy us, if we let it rule. Jesus is the one who can save us from that dark and evil, destructive side. Then if writing and praying doesn't calm me enough, I know the Bible says ""there is safety in a multitude of counselors,"" so I find some trustworthy friend or family member and tell them how I feel. They always understand and have good advice for me. Then I just stay with family and friends for a while and that always calms me down. I will send up a prayer for you!"

4253,Anxiety Forum,79859,Lost control today.,2014-01-23T11:25:51+0000,replier,False,0,,Rose19602,"Hi Maya, So sorry to hear that life and your emotions feel out of control and about the self harm and feelings of desperation.  You have done all the right things by seeking help and therapy, and if you can approach it with the same levels of honesty and determination to get better that you have shown in your thread, I am sure that it will help you.  You have identified periods in your life when the anxiety began, which is always helpful, and you seem to be very able to describe how the anxiety and frustration affects you and your life. You're also able to identify triggers and patterns. All of this helps so much.  You will be under a lot of pressure right now....relationship break down, final year of study, job interviews and an uncertain future. That's a lot for anyone to manage, and as you've said....you can be hard on yourself.  Take it easy, release the pressure with exercise to help with sleep and relaxation, talking (therapy), friends and socialising (to keep your mind off the negative) and delay other pressures like interviews until you feel more able to cope.  Sometimes a break following study is far more helpful than going straight into a full time stressful career. Jobs such as working with kids in holiday camps can provide some respite. They normally also provide accommodation, food and lots of distractions by way of energetic kids (who can also be a nightmare!) and outdoor activity. It doesn't have to be this kind of job....but something temporary and low key might be a good idea whilst you deal with your issues or even taking time out to relax and get your head straight.  Treat yourself gently eh? xxx"

You have issues that need to be dealt with. No one leaves their home with their own child unless something has happened.  I think your issues run deeper than what you have asked on here. Sometimes we all need to get out of a situation that is causing hurt.  He's left you and took his own son with him probably due to your family circumstances.  No person on here can tell you why that happened and why the relationship ended, but please try to move on. And seek out some support.

I then feel bad when anyone does offer cause I'm not used to it and I feel like I should be present and that I'm not allowed to be unwell. I have to be strong for everyone. Click to expand... Bless your heart. Things will take some time to heal. Your worries is what you may like to work on. Kids fall, it is a pre requisit to having a child.  We are all allowed to be unwell. But communication with your partner is paramount to a healthy relationship.  Talk to him (even if it's in stages) but talk.  I suspect your husband loves you, but maybe he finds things difficult. So if you get anything from my message to you, please talk to him.  I'm sending hugs 🫂 just because I can."

It made me so sad when you said you weren't used to anyone agreeing to help you because your family never did. They are the ones who are wrong in that respect.  I was remembering something when I was reading about your feelings of how much you missed your husband. My husband and I had spent nearly 50 years together and we were only a part for an extended time many decades ago when he had to leave for 4 weeks. It's back when there were no cell phones and phone calls were long distance and quite expensive. I miss him so much and I felt so insecure. Fortunately the time passed and he was able to come back home again. It seemed like it took forever.  Unfortunately, now he has passed on and I will probably never get used to living without him, but God left me on Earth for a reason so all I can do is make the best of it. Maybe it's a form of codependency? But I was never truly happy before I met him and I'm not sure I will ever be truly happy again. Sorry. I didn't mean to make this all about me, but I understand how you feel."

I started taking propranolol and have been on it since. It helps with my anxiety (the heart palpitations mostly) but the last year I've noticed my head isn't clear. I kinda feel like I'm high all the time (even though I've never done drugs I imagine this is what it feels like lol) I'm always so tired and just sick of this feeling. Has anyone else felt like this taking propranolol?. I'm thinking about coming off it gradually but want to know if anyone else has had the same and came off and been ok??. I worried about coming off it but I cannot cope with this cloudy high feeling anymore it's making me more anxious!!

I had carried this regret around for a long time and then told my partner who waS amazing about it all and had no issue with it at all - I said I was sorry it won’t and hasent happened again , he forgave me said he is very happy loves me loves what we have how we are and move on he’s not a problem. the moving on and all that seems to be my worry and I just can’t get past what I have done . I was always thinking about it and I did think I was getting ocd about it or had deep anxiety over it . But from reading and and watching various drs and people on like -personal experiences - I think it’s just excessive worry and regrets. Yes I know it’s all a very cose cousin to anxiety and ocds and many of their stress related things .  Self forgiveness is what I need to work on and that I find very hard .

I say that as I have spent many hours understand their caused , their ways , their Symptoms. Of course everyone is different and little things are different to each person . When I got to “ worry” i felt more at home , more in line with my feelings and my emotions. All the above I had discussed with my partner and he supports me regardless of what it might be but he said that once I “ found” worry I became more me and as bad as worry is I became more relaxed .  I think it is that finding your inner strength and feeling and while working on all the areas Something can become clearer for you or is “ more you”.

Have they offered you any therapies. It might be a better start than antidepressants. They can often be hit and miss. I'm sorry I can't recommend any particular one for you.

It is a trycyclic antidepressant not an anxiety medication. I take it for chronic pain and depression. There are so many, keep trying until you find the one for you."

I can identify very much with certain things You describe, expecially how dear and anxiety can wreak havoc on relationship particularly romantic ones and and also at work.I completely identify with being overwhelmed by tasks which require tidyness, organisation etc. Ive always been very sensitive and I find as much as I try yo get a "" thicker skin "" through therapy , it's a combinación of medication and doing activities like art and enjoying Nature which bring me most peace and help me better cope.

I find it quiet hard to focus and also get angry quickly although I have worked on that quiet allot recently.  Somethings I have noticed is I find it hard to follow instructions when I’m at work, directions ect and things that might seem easy to others like finding their way to places, or sorting out letters, appointments, and managing things I get quiet over whelmed and feel allot of pressure and anxiety.  I find myself putting these off allot.    The main challenges has always been feeling very self conscious, fear of being judged, told off or shouted at. It feels like I’m being attacked emotionally (I know its not that but to feels that way.)    I had to stop college courses, university, jobs, lost friendships and struggled in relationships.    That’s because of the social anxiety and agoraphobia.    The last job was 15 years ago and I left because I was getting very anxious and found it really difficult to stay in work.  I have tried many therapies, counselling, hypnosis and spiritual healing and really nothing has helped.  I just feel very anxious all the time and even though recently I have tried got a few job offers I could not take them due to feeling so scared and anxious.    I got the interviews done which was ok but once I have to start I feel allot of dread and I just can’t go in.    And this was what happened in school too, I felt dread and fear if I had to do anything.    It feels like people are talking about me or laughing at me and that’s when I’m feeling allot of anxiety.    I know some people can have anxiety but still go to work, for me I feel scared to death of going back.    I know one thing I have observed is pressure, I feel allot of pressure.    I suppose that’s the anticipatory anxiety.  Yet that pressure and fear has been there since I was a child.    I don’t take medications and have not really been labelled with any conditions that’s also because the doctors would not take it seriously and kept referring me to counselling or cbt which has not helped.  Has anyone here had a similar struggle with getting back into work because of anxiety?  Some of the other things is relationships it just doesn’t go anywhere because one the person wants to get serious I can’t deal with it due to the anxiety.  I forgot I also have ocd and get hyper active its not all the time but its there and is challenging.  Thank you for any help     ? Click to expand... I’m the same way exactly I have suffered my whole life taking Xanax when it got so bad at work or I would explode and just walk out of work and quit only to have to quickly find another job to support my 3 children who were still growing up. I couldn’t take Xanax all the time because it’s highly addictive. So I had to use only so many a month. There are anti depressants that help with anxiety but are not a cure all believe me and some are better than others. Celexa has worked the best for me. I am retired now so I don’t have those pressures any more. My life is so much better now. I know in California you can get disability if you can’t work because of anxiety and other mental health problems but a shrink has to give a diagnosis as such. Here we go with labels again.? I really hope you find something that helps it’s really torture to live this way. I have been told by many mental health professionals that I have been raised in such a dysfunctional family with mother and siblings always making fun of me being dumb and slow by supervisors and teachers it could be part of the problem. I could never concentrate because I was afraid I would be ridiculed for being slow or dumb."

Everything that keeps your peace from you for a long time it’s a great candidate to mental illness, specially when envolving overthinking, fears and physical symptoms. The thing about anxiety that makes us feel the worse is that we can’t know for sure if a certain fear or thing is going to happen or not, and anything that is out of control freaks anxious people out. Unfortunately, I don’t have a solution for you cause I struggle with the same things over things I can’t know are going to happen, but what helped me was searching online for people that relate to me and what others have said to soothe them down. Feeling the feelings also help. Feel the fear and think of the possibility of it happening, is it that common to happen? Are you a prone person for it to happen to you?

Long story short I’ve suffered with health anxiety for years, since I was 9 years old, and I’ve always excessively worried about everything. I’ve recently started counselling to get my anxiety under control and it hasn’t seemed to help so far which stresses me out a lot even though I know I need to accept that these things take time. I’ve also recently been diagnosed with disordered breathing pattern, which as a health anxiety sufferer, of course I thought the symptoms were due to every terrible illness under the sun including lung cancer etc.  Anyway, I’m still finding it extremely hard to accept that this is disordered breathing... I constantly think I’ve been misdiagnosed and that the doctors have missed something despite having tests and them giving me the all clear multiple times. I’m just terrified. I constantly feel like I can’t breathe properly, I need more oxygen, I feel so air hungry, I’m unable to take a deep satisfying breathe, my throat feels tight and clogged (if that makes sense??) ..... as a result this has caused a number of panic attacks which once again, due to health anxiety I can’t accept that they are ‘just’ panic attacks, and it sends me into a frenzy as I think I’m dying.  Please can someone help me with this, if anyone has gone through this or something similar? It feels like a never ending tunnel that I’m trapped in! I’m only young and it’s ruining my life, I’m living in fear of dying from a horrible illness that I have been told a number of times I don’t have. I’m also going on an 11 hour flight in 3 days and I’m absolutely terrified, my home has become my safe place throughout all of this recently and I’m so scared that my breathing will flare up on the plane and I have no way of getting medical attention that I feel I constantly need.  Sorry this is so long! But I’m really struggling and if there’s someone who has suffered/knows someone who has suffered please let me know!  P.S If anyone has any tips/ coping strategies for the plane please let me know because I’m so scared."

Havent had a cigarette since! I use Geekbars and always check that they are the authentic (and therefore regulated) product. But the health anxiety is kicking in. After vaping today my face started to burn quite intensely and I am suddenly afraid that this is an allergic reaction and that if I continue vaping instead of smoking I will at some point go into anaphylactic shock and potentially die. My mind has fixated on this outcome and now I just want to give up and smoke cigs again because they never made my face sting or anything like that. So I was hoping someone who knows a little more about this stuff could help me think this through more clearly? Is this a rational fear?

I believe it’s “better” for you than smoking traditional cigarettes. I am not saying it is “healthy” or “safe” at all. Vaping definitely posses health risks  I have never heard of this reaction but it’s possible. Usually the three ingredients in juice are vegetable glycerin, propolyne glycol and nicotine. If you wanted you could buy a small thing of each individual ingredient and take a cotton swab to dip a tiny bit on your hand to see if it causes a reaction.  If it continues I would talk to a doctor for better tests. In the meantime you could try switching to the highest reputable brand possible (a big one here’s like I said is Mr.Vapor) and see if that helps and continue to monitor and see the doctor for an allergy test  Please be careful I don’t want anything bad to happen to you"

It’s easier and doesn’t irritate at all. Vaping helped me quit smoking cigarettes and now I can go months without vaping.  If you really want to quit smoking, I’d say give it sometime. You’ll get used to it. By the way, e-liquid ingredients are used in many products that you might be using daily like hand sanitizer, soap 🧼, lotion, cake, candy, medication and the list goes on.

I'm worried now because I got oral from one and I'm scared that I'm gonna get STD's like aids or something. Whats the first signs I mean how would you know if you get aids do you like get sick or something?  I don't really care if I die just as long as I don't die painfully. It makes me feel good about myself meeting people but at the same time I can sometimes feel dirty afterwards then sit in the bath scrubbing myself for ages and washing my cloths. I'd really prefer a relationship but they only want me for sex. I don't think I'm good enough for a relationship anyway really I should be greatful for what I can get besides there are some people that don't get anything.

Part of the buzz for me was the associated risk; the riskier the better, or, the riskier the more of a turn on it would seem at the time. I did some truly outlandish things on occasion; including the CCTV scenario I learned some time later than many people with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder can engage in risky sexual behaviour. That's not to say that all of them do, of course, but that a great many do; a fairly high percentage. I don't know your diagnostic history of course and it may be unrelated anyway, but for me I think it played a part. That 'you only live once' voice in your head was a familiar one for me. I found in the end however that the experiences made me happy in the short term but unhappy in the long term. They satisfied an immediate need or desire; scratched an itch, but ended up exacerbating my feelings of low self worth long term. Not being a killjoy WheatCrunchies, just saying make sure you're safe, first of all, but in quiet moments try to ascertain how the behaviour is making you feel over time. If it's negatively impacting on your self-esteem in the long run then perhaps amend your behaviour accordingly. If not however, I guess just take as many precautions as you can, both prophylactic and physically, and have an effing good time old bean haha  Cheers,  Monster"

The situation has made me very anxious and that has turned into tensions which has been very hard to deal with at times. It was to do with a Filipino girl on Facebook who wanted me to befriend her, and wanted to talk in chat rooms every day for over 2 hours every day, and Skype. When I have tried to stop she makes out that she misses me and is very sad and emotional about it, and posts sob-stories on Facebook which makes me feel very guilty. My mum is convinced she's a scammer after my money, or something malicious. I can't find anything to prove that, so I am much less sure. I have tried to reason with her and told her I don't want to chat everyday, but I'm still feeling guilty and feel like she is controlling me as thought I'm her slave. I have episodes of extreme anxiety and tension over it still. I wish I knew what to do. I have tried to see the doctor but he was unavailable before Christmas. I want to stop chatting to her altogether really but I feel I will hurt her bad, and I can't bring myself to do it. I keep feeling sorry for her. I don't fancy her either, although she says she really likes me. She has made me ill. Its a vicious circle, she feels toxic, I feel like being as far from her as possible. Is that normal feeling? Is that fair? She has a baby and I feel sorry for the baby too. Is there anyway of coping with my anxiety here? Has anyone got any suggestions, has anyone been in this kind of situation? The anxiety has made me ill. I don't know what to do"

There is a big scam industry related to this. There are a number of websites warning people of various scams. I have just looked on line and have seen enough to make me think that all is not right for you and your instinct is correct. I do not think that the mods would let the link stay up if I post it here.  Please do an engine search on Phillipines internet scams.  The people who do this scams are very skilled at manipulating others online. It is a kind of brain washing, with a sad story to make you feel bad if you break contact. They prey on people who are lonely and kind.  Often the ""sob story"" is about education fees, or family, or some terrible misfortune. In my view, she seems to be using her ""baby"" to manipulate you. Think about it. Any real and genuine mum would not go on an internet site and use a baby as an emotional lever.  If she is showing you the baby on a web cam, then that is very concerning, and you may want to consider drawing it to the attention of a specialist child protection unit online if you can.  You will not be in any trouble at all yourself, I promise. They can determine if things are genuine or a scam Child Exploitation & Online Protection Centre - internet safety - CEOP  That is just my view, but I am concerned for you and how ill it is making you.

I suppose the problem for me is not being absolutely sure. That is: could she otherwise be a lonely girl with some problems who is after some love and attention? I have this weakness which is that I don't like to emotionally upset people, even if that means upsetting myself. It has got me into lots of difficulties in the past, for example I exchanged my house for another although I had changed my mind. I could have said no and backed away but I didn't want to upset the other person. Its going to require some strength on my part to block her. When I tried to blank her she wrote on her facebook status: I miss u so bad she looks such a nice girl with her cute baby in tow. I wasn't going to message her but after I did the tensions started to regenerate. The reason I'm posting here is because it has caused me a lot of anxxiety and tension, and I think it has made me ill. When I skype her it's for over an hour, and she just seems so toxic. I cant cope at all with her, not even on Facebook. She is using a false name, and it would be really helpful if I knew that she was a scam before blocking her. She wanted me to go to the Philippines, but I told her I didn't fancy her, and we have sent each other almost 3000 messages in the chatrooms since December 8th. I really messed up Christmas. I even Skyped her on Christmas day. This weakness of mine has caused me more problems."

I'm the same; I usually prefer to hurt myself than hurt someone else, but that hasn't got me anywhere good over the years. You're thinking about her feelings, but from what you've said, it doesn't sound like she's thinking about yours very much. If your instinct tells you this situation with her is toxic, that's probably because it is.  I don't think you'll ever know for sure whether she's part of a scam or not. But you've said yourself that keeping in contact with this person is making you ill, and to me that's reason enough to break contact with anyone. I know it sounds harsh, but her problems (if they exist at all, and are not part of some scam) are not your problems. It's not up to you to 'fix' things for her; you have the right to walk away.

I don't think I'm ready to unfriend her quite yet, building up to that perhaps is how I am thinking. I'm hoping to feel that she really is a nuisance, and have a stronger case maybe. The big problem for me is the anxiety. When she gets to me I get anxious, which leads to tensions and feeling helpless, and then all I can think about is that rather than the actual problem and how to solve it. I go around in circles when I'm anxious. She hasn't actually asked me for money directly either, which the search engines talk of the scams, although she hinted at it to start with. When I told her no she stopped asking. She wants me to go to the Philippines though, and although I have more or less said no to her I think that she hopes I could change my mind. Some men who go to the Philippines to meet girls get robbed, or get married and then divorce when the girl has got her visa. She knows that I think her baby is very cute. She messaged me on Facebook this morning but I haven't replied as yet, this is what she said: 'yeah we can skype again..just let me know if when so that i know..we are goo.and we hope that u are good also..take care ur self always <3<3.. ..me and (her baby's name) miss u..' To be honest I do find that obtrusive, she has mentioned Skype again and last Sunday the Skype went on for over an hour, so I'm worried about that. Sometimes it pays to become Mr Nasty if that means helping yourself I suppose."

I expect you can see by the 2 messages I got this morning how manipulative she is, i.e. she squeezes me into corners and I feel a need to say what she wants me to say. She is reasonably pretty, yes, but not really my type. She makes herself sound like she's a poor young lady who desperately needs love and attention, and when I don't give it to her she breaks down. Yes I heard about Operation Endeavour this morning and I read about the scams, and the one problem with this person is that she doesn't actually ask for money, but that's probably because I told her I wouldn't send it. It makes me more unsure whether she is a scam though, but I now feel that she is being irresponsible because she is not in tune with my feelings, she is definitely on some sort of mission. The word that best describes her is toxic. I'm going to stop messaging her, and I hope that will lead up to me being able to block her and the other 2 members of her family who have befriended me, her brother and sister. Her 'so called' sister keeps changing her name every few days. Its the young lady who's name is false not her 2 year old baby, but who knows. You are right, it's not about being Mr Nasty, its about doing the only thing I can do because she is making me ill, but their are other concerns. I've heard that when men go to the Philippines the family sometimes drug them and rob them.  Thanks for your concerns x"

It's rather sad to think that I might be blocking someone who just has the hots for me, and needed some care and attention, like some people do here I guess. On the other hand she is causing me a lot of anxiety by her behaviour, and her pressure. It seems funny why all of her family wanted to add me to Skype, not just her. So many things don't add up, but nothing actually proves she is a scam. She wants to be in chat rooms/Skype for hours at a time, and puts pressure on me to do so, so what else can I do but block her? My mum says she is definitely a scam, but I can't see it like that. I confused about whose page my mum is on to be honest.

I'm going to show a lot of restraint to this lady, and ignore her messages a lot more now, and that might help me to see she is a scam if she reacts bizarrely to this That will make me feel a lot better when I do block her, I will be much more sure she is a scam if she reacts bizarrely, and in the meantime I will be more convinced I've got back control, which I really hope will help the anxiety.

You could ask her for money, and see what the response is! Tell a story about how poor you are, and what you could do with a few dozen pounds to lighten your load. I bet she would disappear like snow before the wind  Well I don't know what to think, I have Skyped her this morning, and now she wants to come to me now, it's not about me going to see her anymore, she wants to come to England complete with her baby, and wants to save up and work for it. She knows that we are not actually going out with each other but wants to give it a chance by coming to me. I don't know how this is going to affect me stress wise yet , I better get to the doctors quick I think . Show me the way someone, life is changing very fast"

I would be the first to admit this could be a scam, and I've read it up on it on all the search engines, but if she is willing to work, save up her money and come to England then I have to wonder about that. As everyone with problems reading this knows, it is so difficult to get a girlfriend in this country (England). Lots of the dating agencies are scams, and it's well known, because they pretend that people like you when these people don't exist, they are created so as to make money from 'lonely hearts'. Also, for a lot of people here, there only ideals are in terms of money and status, and anything else wont do. People like me, who have had problems are conveniently put into little boxes, and are not suppose to marry. If this lady from the Philippines has different ideals then it's wrong for me to simply dismiss her. She might well be my only hope of love, she puts a lot of effort into it, and is thankful for the smallest of things. Lets hope she's genuine, she obviously likes me a lot more than I like her, I think she knows that, but then again something could develop if we meet each other. In this country, if you haven't conformed in the past, you are placed into a little box where you are suppose to be 'happy' and accept loneliness. I just hope I can cope with the stress, that's the issue, if I didn't get anxious it would be much easier, but obviously there is a lot to be anxious about here, and I hope the anxiety doesn't take over and cloud my judgements. It's not a straightforward relationship. Anyway I'm much calmer today than I was yesterday."

The 2 year old is her baby so she's bound to want to show her off to me from time to time, she doesn't do that every time, only twice so far. Her parents are bound to be around sometimes because she lives with them. The reason she has so much time for chat rooms is because she looks after her baby, and both her parents work. If she was chatting to other people she would have to be using multiple Facebook accounts, otherwise they would be posting on her status like I do. I told her that I wouldn't go to the Philippines, my reason is that it would simply be too dangerous, her answer to that is she will come to me. If she comes here with her baby it would be safer for me, and I could weigh her up more easily. My concern is that she wont come here, rather she will change her story and hope I will change my mind and go there. I don't know whether that's going to happen yet, but if she did it would prove she was a liar and therefore more likely a scam. I don't want to pre-judge her, innocent till proven guilty, there are bound to be decent Filipinos as well. I just need to be careful. If she is a scam I'll catch her out eventually I'm sure she hasn't done anything so far that makes me convinced she is one, and doesn't ask for money. Even so I take your point, I know she could be one. Thanks for your concern anyway. My main concern is how I will cope with a difficult relationship like this, will I become ill with anxious thoughts which will cloud my judgements, and I'll end up back on my own again without giving her a chance I don't want to go back to the life of dodgy dating sites, filling myself with false hopes, and losing money"

The whole thing felt wrong, but I decided not to just block her, I wanted to tell her in truthful terms why I felt the relationship needed to end, and that I wasn't that attracted to her. I told her of my concerns about her false name and that she might be a scammer. I told her everything I felt, so she knew. It was either carrying on and becoming ill or being single again and getting better. If she is devastated, I am truly sorry, but the whole thing was created because of her constant pressure. This has been the worse experience I've had in a very long time, I feel like crying, but I'm determined not to because I have cried before over this.

I had a bad afternoon yesterday at the shops feeling sorry for this girl, but held back the tears. The problem is that the pressure must have built up because within 30 seconds of coming home I was in tears, in the end I cried 4 times yesterday evening. I was actually in a really bad way feeling sorry for this lady that I hadn't given her a chance, when in fact it may have been worth taking a chance on her. I kept thinking of things to message her with to help me but every time decided against it, I couldn't sleep very well. This morning I decided that I would try to make amends with this lady and told her that I didn't feel it right that she comes to England because it was causing me stress. She seemed very reluctant to answer all the time and kept saying things like 'I hope you will find a girl and be happy with her', and 'you deserve someone better'. I kept apologising to her for being blunt yesterday, but it's like she was saying 'how can I trust you now', and actually she did ask me this. It didn't make sense really because I hadn't really done that much wrong to speak my mind. I said I was willing to be good friends and to chat and Skype, but nothing else for now because of stress, there seemed to be reluctance on her part. She also said her Grandfather was ill. Does anyone know of an organization like the police who could find out if she's up to something, or part of a ring? I do need some help but have absolutely no-one to turn to. I'm in a very difficult position because if I dump her I will get very, very upset and broken hearted which could affect me for a long time, or if I carry on I might be brainwashed by a scammer (if she is one). There doesn't seem to be any way to report her on Facebook, I tried but they haven't done anything at all. I just need someone to find out for sure and tell me if she's up to something sinister."

If there's no chance of things going any further than online chat, she's suddenly not so interested. Then she uses a story about her grandfather being ill to try and guilt trip you. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but this is how it reads to me. Sorry.  I don't think you'll ever know the truth about her, but this is my perspective on it going by what you've said in this thread."

I can't persuade her otherwise, she's cold all of a sudden and says that its because she doesn't want to get hurt anymore, she said I hurt her too much by spelling out my fears on Monday. I told her that I think that she is a part of a ring and that she has been told to dump me, her answer is 'God knows she isn't'. She is completely cold. My suspicions are that she wanted me to change my mind and go to the Philippines and then the 'team' would rob me and march me to a cash point and rob me again, and then tell me to be on my way. I don't think she was ever going to come to England, she just hoped I would change my mind. Her team told her to dump me, my rejection on Tuesday was the last straw for them. I think my fears were founded, if she was a real person she would have accepted my apology for Tuesday."

She is acting slightly colder today, is that understandable, is the fact that I showed doubts about this relationship on Tuesday reason for her to be so upset and cold? I just don't know myself. I can't go through what I did on Tuesday again so this time its 'innocent until proved guilty', that's it, I hope to know one way or another soon. She wont come to England if she's a scam because it wouldn't be worth paying out all that money for, so then there's nothing to worry about, I think that I will work her out soon. I woke up tense and anxious not knowing how she would be today but she has chatted, but without the hearts and stuff, perhaps its more to do with her wanting to keep me as a friend after I threatened to unfriend her yesterday. Maybe, maybe not. This obviously has further to run. She said she needs time to build up her trust in me and doesn't want to be hurt again. She's mentioned that she's going to see her sick grandfather tomorrow, wash clothes and go to church. I suppose that's a normal thing for a Philippine lady to do. Maybe, maybe not again."

Sometimes I think friends don't really know what to say or how to act for the best. I'm sure if they knew just how deeply affected you have been (and still are) by the anxiety then they'd want to help you out. I suppose it's just not something that people really know how to deal with, because it's not something that really gets talked about. What kind of support would you like from them? Sometimes I think it's just better to ask outright than wait for an offer. I know it's extremely difficult to reach out.. I never do, because i'm too worried about it. But people aren't mind-readers, and so if there is something you need (i.e. maybe someone who you can call when things are getting too much) then say.  It sounds like there have been stressful changes in your life, and so there does seem to be an explanation for your anxiety to be triggered again. Have you made any appointments to see your GP or anything? It might be helpful to chat to them and explain how you are feeling. Ideally, you can nip this in the bud or at least get some control over it, before it goes back to how bad it was before. x"

I occasionally get very focused on the urge to swallow, and not when eating or drinking. It’s almost like I feel I can’t take a breath until I have completed a swallow. Now, this comes and goes and it certainly A lot worse with a hangover, so I’m fairly sure it’s anxiety! The bigger problem now is that I’ve recently started running. This is compounding the problem as, when I feel the need to swallow, I will focus on that and basically not breathe until I’ve managed a swallow, which is very uncomfortable and panic raising when out of breath.  Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms; a google search also pointed towards OCD...  It’s alleviated if I have a bottle of water to hand, as the fear of not being able to swallow fades, then I don’t try to swallow. The issue here is that I have become very dependent on always having a bottle of water to hand - stopping me carrying out certain activities.  Appreciate any advice or experience in this matter. It’s already affected my left and career in so many ways, I would like to beat it before much longer."

And also, please see your GP, for a mental health team referral, t hey will then reasess your anxiety, and take things from there.  Further, could you possibly try listening to or watch music, that might help you to take your mind of things temporarily.  Back to the other topic, your GP or mental health team, once referred, they will possibly write up ah, I hadn't realised, that, well, the pshychartrist, ought to know about writing up a prescription for anxiety, and they should be able to write up, prescription for depression, such as ant idepressants.  Sounds like to me you need to have be referred back, and gain a 2nd pshychartry opinon.   Best Wishes,  I''m Natalie, and I suffer have done with anxiety, though i don't have depression, I am on medication for anxiety, and I listen to musicasl and music to help me out, as well, plus I'll workout in fitness, to fitness, dvds, and I'm re planning zumba attendances.

It’s a difficult one as i’ve only been there 2 months, I had one day off last week due to feeling dizzy; which i put down to anxiety and have since found out is a uti! but my manager asked “if it’s a long term thing”, i’ve had it since i was 7 and am 24 next month! i told her it’s not a cold, and as much as i’d love it to not be a long term thing, it is! the difficulty is i need a job to earn a wage and pay my rent (whilst saving for a mortgage) some days I can cope and others I am struggling! Although i’ve not had suicidal thoughts, i feel like i’m just being and haven’t got much to look forward to (i have no longer issues, good (apart from the manager) paid job, amazing family/friends and partner) i just feel so down!  I am taking antidepressants and beta blockers for the anxiety - i am undergoing CBT, i may go back to my GP to be re referred to a psychologist again.. i just feel ill day to day, generally worn out and emotionally/mentally drained! I have no enthusiasm to do things anymore, even such as cooking and housework, i physically force myself to do it and reward myself with a nap afterwards lol and go for easy option dinners! Some days I tell myself to get a grip, and it works! Others I just take to my bed if i can, or as soon as i finish work!x"

I have also set up daily plan to help my mind - up some fitness I like to cycle and then home dogs out - shower - some meditation and start my day . I have other normal daily activities as well. Then some more meditation at night just 5/10 min. I also use “ rescue remedy “ spray and that helps and getting various essential oils in the hope they will claim me. For me it’s self forgiveness I don’t know yet how to achieve that and that is my goal.

The fact that I can be almost anonymous helps me to open up about the demons I have been fighting in the last year. One year ago today, my ex boyfriend left me pregnant and ever since that day, time has stopped. Even though I am over him, I can’t get over what he did. Not many people know about this and not many people knew I was pregnant back then. The pain and shame were hidden behind almost complete silence. The last day I ever saw him he said that we couldn’t be together and that he just thought we “couldn’t work out”. I was at his mother’s house that day. I was extremely sick with morning sickness and was lying in bed throwing up every now and then. That’s when he told me that. He then drove me back home and he didn’t say a word throughout the whole ride back. He only spoke after he parked up underneath my house. He said that he may change his mind later on or he may never change his mind. He said he still wanted to be involved. I remember getting off the car and telling him “we’ve done nothing wrong to you”. He didn’t say another word, he just drove off. He said he wanted to be involved and he knew how sick I was but the next day and the following ones, he completely disappeared. He never sent a text, that next day he went go-karting with his friends. He then disappeared completely, no one single contact was made. On the day of my birthday 3 weeks later, he didn’t even send a text to say happy birthday. Nothing at all, other than silence. This broke me beyond belief and I suffered a miscarriage at 11 weeks. I went through all of that on my own, I went through the whole sickness on my own as well. I recall just crawling out of bed in the early hours of each morning, to lay on the floor and cry my eyes out. This routine has not changed. I can understand if two people cannot be together even if they have a baby, but then why disappear like that? I never could get an answer. Fast-forward to one year, time has never moved forward for me. I am stuck in that moment and I am losing my mind. I spend my days in total solitude, sometimes laying on the floors in the dark and crying. Things are really bad and I have been contemplating suicide for a while now. I just feel scared, I feel alone and all I want is someone to hug me and tell me I am fine. I am so scared and alone, I can’t see a tomorrow in any of my days. He loves to race (he pays a lot of money for it, he’s not a professional, more like an expensive hobby) and I believe he silently walked away so that we could not interrupt the life he wanted to continue living. Perhaps he also wanted to buy some time, leaving me alone so that eventually I wouldn’t take it anymore and have an abortion. I don’t know what he was thinking but I do know I can’t watch F1 anymore, I go insane when it’s even on TV. I am alone and devastated and feel like I cannot carry on like this anymore. I have extreme anxiety daily, I have nightmares about him. It used to be me searching for him, now it’s him running away. I wake up with anxiety, and then I cry. It just feels so lonely when I wake up like this. It is so bad that sometimes I am unable to go in the office after these nightmares. I just there was someone here holding my hand as I wake up like this, but there is no one. I live with extreme anxiety every single day and I get to the end of the day that I am devastated. It feels like I am fighting a battle and right now I am losing. I was talking to someone else on whatsapp up until a couple of weeks ago, someone I really liked. For some reason, when I was talking to him, my mind was clear. However, we just didn’t seem to get along and we’d fight a lot. I started getting anxiety because I didn’t know what I was saying to him that was making things worse. He is the one who told me that I have “walls” around me and I had no idea at all until he said that. Now I know what he means. Apart from people at work, I avoid everyone else. I am withdrawn, alone and scared. And as I type this, I’m heavily medicated. I don’t even know if I am even making sense here. I don’t think there will be a tomorrow for me, I feel like I am shutting down, like I am reaching the end of my life."

It does improve in time but not getting any support makes it a lot harder to move through the morass of feelings. Its a total emotion by which I mean it is all consuming and exhausting to go through.  Try to stay focused on the present. It is so hard I know. But suicide is such a final step and its a way of trying to evade the pain you are in. Have you got input from MH services at all? I read that you are medicated but you need a crisis team as well. Can you go back to your GP and tell them that you are in such a desperate state and need more input. It will take courage but its a positive step forward. Please try to stay safe whilst you work through this awful pain you are in.

And then we started fussing at the end of the conversation he said he wanted me to get an abortion. I just broke down my world felt like it was crashing down on me and he said if I didn’t get one he wasn’t gonna be around to help me. Long story short I cried every night until I went to the doctors and I talked to the doctors and they gave me a list of doctors where I can get my care and they also had abortion clinics. That night I went home I cried and cried and I decided to call the abortion center and schedule an appointment. I did but I wasn’t sure if I was gonna go through with it or not so I was debating for a week because my appointment was on a weekend. That was the hardest week of my life so the weekend got here I couldn’t sleep the night before because I was up crying, so on my way to the abortion clinic I called my “so called” boyfriend again and he didn’t answer so at that point I knew I had to go through with it because I knew I didn’t want to raise a baby by myself. I remember like it was yesterday I went in filled out paperwork and they did an ultrasound ( which I still have the picture) then the nurses came in to talk to us about how to take the pill and what will happen. That day was pure hell I went home crying to the point I had gotten sick to my stomach. That was the worst day of my life still until this day I regret my decision to get an abortion. I shouldn’t have did it and that’s something I have to live with for the rest of my life, which has a lot to do with my depression today. I’m so sorry you had to go through wat you did."

I was only 21 and he was my first boyfriend. He was my world at that time. I was also dumb to get myself into this situation in the first place. I was so heartbroken that it ended. I was left with my son to take care of. I couldn't see myself with any other man. What healed me was time. It's not easy but hang in there.

She’s been living with me in the the UK for 4 years and it’s now my turn to do a stint in her home country, at least for 4 years to match the time she has spent here. She is wonderful, caring and supportive.    I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to go, but I have a lot of concern and worry, namely about my mum. We’ve always been close and have a good relationship, although I would also describe it as codependent. I’m very protective of her and would say I’ve been substitute husband figure to her in a way.    She’s a lovely warm lady and has worked as a frontline care worker for 20 years. She has always put others before herself, but in turn has neglected her own wellness and sometimes her own responsibilities to her house and relationships. She’s also had issues with alcohol. She had a fractured childhood with lots of abuse and trauma. I’ll be honest, in moments of frustration, I’ve resented her need to help others when she hasn’t helped herself.    Last year my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I was her main support giver. She is now in recovery, which is fantastic although it’s been a much longer process than we both anticipated.    My mum lives with my brother and his manipulative girlfriend and allow this girl to take advantage of them both despite acknowledging how unhappy they are.  The girlfriend speaks to them poorly, misuses the family home and spends my brothers money. Of course I only have so much say in these matters as I do not live at home and it’s not my business. Through therapy and boundary setting, I’ve tried to support while keeping a distance. This has been painful for me, yet for my own health I’ve accepted I need to step back sometimes. I no longer speak to my brothers girlfriend.    So now I find myself on the cusp of moving to Australia, and I’m very anxious about leaving my mum as I’m not sure how’ll she’ll cope. I think I may have even made it harder for her but overstepping my care. My brother does not offer much in way of support.    I’m now days away from moving and my wife deserves my full commitment and engagement in this next step, but I’m struggling. I know my mum wants me to be happy, but she is struggling too.    Can anyone give me some advice as how to best navigate this situation?"

I hope you will find this a supportive and friendly place to visit, especially at a time like this when the 'geography' of your life is about to change. In answer to your question:  In essence, it does not seem that there will be a change in how little or how much you can influence your mother's home life or the decisions she makes wherever you live.  Set up good communication lines with your mum, i.e., regular phone/internet contact. As you will be further away geographically, you can use this as a good rationale to regularise, increase/decrease contact and maintain your current detachment (which might be helpful to you both).  As you say 'my wife deserves my full commitment and engagement in this next step' and you and your mother will find this very significant transition a struggle. Hopefully, you will both also be able grow as a result of dealing with the challenges involved.  Despite all these upheavals, I hope you do manage to have a happy Christmas!!"

My Dad lives overseas and I don't see him very often - he's come to stay for three weeks, on and off (travelling in between, mostly on his own). During the week I'm at work but we go out in the evenings, and in the weekends I spend all day with him (although have left him to his own devices a couple of Saturday evenings to go see friends). I've also taken time off work to do a side trip with him this coming week.  It's been so lovely but I also feel really wrung out. He decided he'd stay in a hotel nearby this weekend - I know he felt he was imposing, and frankly, he probably wanted a break as well - and I asked if he would mind if I had Saturday night to Monday morning to myself just to do some work stuff. Yes I did really have a bit of work stuff but also I just wanted some alone time. (Work has been manic and I have had little down time for myself.)  Of course he's OK with it, but I have spent that whole period feeling guilty that he's in a hotel on his own, and I should really be taking him out for another day or at least take him out for another dinner. I guess it's different when you have a partner, or they have a partner, so that you can take the pressure off. And Dad's so easygoing that it almost makes me feel worse. (I can't really talk to him about it as we don't have that sort of heart-to-heart relationship.)  I wish I didn't feel like this. He's here one more week after this ""day off"" and I am seeing him almost full time for that final week. So I know I shouldn't feel guilty. Yet I do. It's making my anxiety skyrocket. ""I am being selfish. I should be a better daughter. It's the weekend, you should be spending the day with him. Your Dad is only here once. He's come here to see you."" I worry so much about being kinder to my Dad that I am probably being unkind to myself.  I always feel this way with family and I don't really know why.

This isn't the first time I've experienced this, but I'll talk about what I'm experiencing currently:  It started a couple days ago, late one night, I noticed something in the vision of my right eye (like when you stare at a light, and look away, you can see sort of an after image). It isn't intrusive, and I have to try and look for it. And day by day it's been gradually getting better, but i'm constantly trying to search for it, (i.e blinking, so I can see it, doing this in different lights -constantly checking myself) and just generally obsessing about it. It's not very major at all - if I didn't know to look for it, I probably wouldn't notice it.  I obviously consulted Dr Google, after being reassured by friends and family that It's probably something to do with migraines that I have experienced recently, as I do get visual symptoms. Dr Google as you could expect, as I should know, did not help at all, and made me fear a whole host of ailments, and lead me to panic.  After speaking to friends and family, it's likely that I can attribute this visual disturbance/migraine thing to the uncertainty of the current climate with coronavirus, and a large change in my lifestyle (just moved, changed jobs, now working from home etc), which in turn affects stress and anxiety.  In order to try and put my mind at rest, I consulted an eye specialist, and was able to have a consultation over video-link. She wasn't concerned at all, and again, suggested it's likely down to something to do with a migraine, which certainly seems likely, as migraines tend to come on (for me at least) at times of change in lifestyle/eating etc.  However, with my health worry, I start to doubt what the doctor was saying, I start to doubt the reassurance. Whenever I reassure myself, I then look for something to worry about.  The strategy I'm using at the moment, is that if I have an episode of where I look for this visual disturbance, or notice it and start checking it, I ease myself with a number of thoughts, such as 'I have checked this with a professional who was not concerned,' and 'It's probably a migraine, which is likely at this time' etc.  I was just wondering if anyone in the community has had any similar experiences or has any advice? All help is appreciated!"

Essentially I had just started a very busy new job (something I’ve always wanted but I think the reality of how much work/ responsibility/ stress it will be has kicked in). It’s been a up and down start and I’m not entirely sure what the CEO thinks of me yet (he is brutally honest about performance that I’ve never had before).  On top of that I’m now getting used to going back to the office for afew days a week however we have a toddler now so it’s all about managing morning and evening times without me feeling bad about leaving work early/ or arriving late. Also my wife is pregnant with our second due August and that is playing on my mind (it’s going to be so hectic when the baby arrives).  Overall I’m just feeling really overwhelmed at the moment trying to be a good dad for my daughter, help my pregnant wife (inc all the household chores and admin) and trying to settle and impress in my new job.  Who’s been in my position and any advice to help my anxiety (struggling to sleep most nights at the moment)."

Does this give you anxiety/ depression?,2016-06-18T00:58:04+0100,author,True,53827,London,DoWeHaVeApUrPoSe???,"I find it incredibly hard to be happy, motivated, determined, enthusiastic etc as i constantly have this thought in my head. I suffer with depression and anxiety and it seems to be getting worse with age. I just dont understand why us human beings live how we live when we are here for such a short period of time and when our lives can change for the worse so unexpectedly. I hate how we are forced to live throughout the world and i hate what ‘work’ has become. People have become so selfish, greedy and materialistic and its like people live to work even when the majority of people do not even like what they do. When i look at how we live our lives and what people care about i can’t help but think its all so pointless and we shouldn’t be living like this when our lives are over so soon. I find it so difficult to be motivated to work, slaving away for a wage that I’m not happy with everyday just to pay the bills. On the flipside i also seem to find it impossible to put the work into doing something that i wouldn’t mind doing like something associated with music for example, because even then I’m thinking fair enough i might like music but i don’t like the unnecessary rules that come with doing it as a career, the stress etc it just turns something you love into something you hate and then at the same time i just don’t have the drive to take it seriously because in the back of my mind I’m thinking this is all going to come to an end one day so what is the point. The only thing that helps me to understand this world and the way we live is religion but even religion doesn’t give me the drive to go out and work anymore and i am scared of the life i am going to have if i don’t work. All these thoughts about injustice, poverty, the purpose of life, death, inequality etc are on my mind 24/7 and are making me so depressed and making me isolate myself and making it impossible for me to focus and get by in life. WHAT DO I DO?"

As soon as I removed my earbuds and the music stopped I suddenly became overly aware of a strong sense of persecution complex bearing down on me like hordes of Demons that are looking down on me scrutinizng every movement every thought and critizing me so much that it became completely unbearable and I had to leave the bus and walk the rest of my Journey Home.

So it sounds like you're really doing well, on paper, but you feel crisis looming if you can't reduce the anxiety.  My own experience was that I had to move away from just trying to salve the anxiety and concentrate on an OCD dynamic. It sounds like you have two of the markers of that kind of issue with rumination and looking for reassurance about the same thing with multiple people but finding no relief.  Does that sound like it applies to you?  If so, rumination is your enemy here."

Every time you have these bursts of fear, your brain gets hurt. Every time you do anything other than letting the fear pass, you're training your brain to search out and even manufacture the pain that gets notice.  I think the answer is that modern life really confuses some of the brain systems we acquired through Evolution. Those brain systems keep telling us to stop thinking about an elephant. Soon, all we can think about are elephants."

Two thing: First, I think the NHS is a perfect place to suggest to managers that they can combine CBT and management for employees who are suffering.  Second, I've come to believe that OCD sufferers come to suffer even more by taking half-measures. Keeping the plague of anxiety, doubt, stress and pain out of your life has to be your top priority - particularly at 24."

I was befriended by someone who started asking for my help in a creative capacity on music and related areas a few years back. We used to socialise and go on trips etc. But it always felt like there was something I'd be asked to do for free after. I started to feel manipulated because he knew I was too polite to say no and risk ending my limited social life.  Every time he contacts me now I an worried what's his next plan he wants my help with and makes me anxious and even had dreams about it. I feel hes slightly deluded as none of his schemes get anywhere and even feel sorry for him, but when its costing me time and my own money I'm not sure what to do for the best. Its making me depressed like I'm not in control of my own life.  Some people would probably run a mile but when you have autism you cant really afford to get rid friends. Thanks for any help here."

If you play some relaxing music and use slow, circular motions on the soles of your feet, you can slow your pulse and bring your blood pressure down. It takes the tension out of the whole of your body and makes it very easy to relax.  If you don't have any moisturiser, just use cooking oil from the kitchen.  Make sure the rest of your body is relaxed - you're lying back on the sofa or in a comfortable chair.  Hope the feeling passes Bev - but keep talking to us if you're nervous.

I think they may be signs of anxiety from what people I know with anxiety have said. So these things started about 4 months ago and have been extremely regular ever since: - Dizzy spells, at least twice a day. - Irregular heartbeat, like palpatations. - sort of nausea, mixed with a feeling of pressure on my chest. - Detachment from my body/ mind. I don't really know how to explain but its like nothing is in focus and I'm not physically present? - Sometimes hard to breathe, like I may wake up at night and not be able to breath. - May be unrelated, but I get disturbing thoughts and dreams  These things usually all happen at the same time, a combination all at once. It's not an extreme feeling but it happens a few times a day and I need to block everything out and breath to go back to normal. I haven't been to a doctor about it because it may be nothing and doctors are always really busy. Anyway, thanks for reading"

It took about 6 weeks to fully get into my system. But works so well obviously everyone is different but it slows the heart rate so you can't have all the panic symptoms.

But for me 2 tablets once a day definitely helps. Also if you start just cause your having a good day or week or month keep taking them! Unless your doctor tells you to stop. I made the mistake of coming off them when I first started and for them to work fully you need to take them the same time everyday and carry on taking them.

I thought it as a blood pressure med that also helps with migraines.  Propranolol simply put slows down your heart rate.  This has the effect of making it easier for your heart to pump blood around the body - which helps High Blood Pressure  Migraines can be caused by rush of blood, or strain in the blood vessels or the pulse in your temple sounding like it is thudding - reducing your heart beat helps all of these causes and therefore can prevent these causes of migraines  Main physical symptom of anxiety is your heart racing, this then causes sweating, shaking and other symptoms and can build into panic attack. People then get anxious about others noticing the physical symptoms and the anxiety builds and you can get into an Anxiety cycle where anxiety is causing further anxiety. Propranolol prevents your heart racing which prevents the other physical symptoms and can reduce anxiety because you don't have to worry about the physical symptoms of anxiety and stop that cycle.  I hope that helps"

I was then referred to a therapist to assess me, who passed me on to a Psychiatrist, however it's been three weeks of waiting to speak to the Psychiatrist, and I feel alone and scared. I just really need to put this energy out there, because it's festering in my brain, and I worry that it's boring to everyone else. I just need to know somebody's read it. I don't think I even need replies, just to know it's out there in the world and not trapped in my brain.  I've just had a week off work, and I have to go back tomorrow. Trying to explain the panic in my stomach, the headache, the nose-dive in my mood, the fear... I keep getting told it's ""back to work blues"". It's not. I think I'm getting worse. I'm allowing myself to create scenarios for tomorrow that have no basis in reality. I feel on the verge of a panic attack. I just can't take in any more negative energy right now, and I know there will be problems that people won't have dealt with, and I will have to do it. Either that, or when I've been off they've decided actually that they don't really need me there anymore, and that I don't do as much as I think I do. Illogical, I know. All consuming, yes.  I'm so stressed out by life at the moment. I cleaned my apartment to within an inch of it's life this week, arranged everything just so, but now I'm looking around constantly to see what's misaligned... the floor is so clean you could eat off it, but I can't help looking for smudges.  I'm so tired of my stupid ritualistic behaviour (I have to touch the centre of my forehead and brush out, and then my chest, then my forehead again) when I think bad thoughts, and it's exhausting. I've been doing this for over ten years now, and I didn't think anybody noticed. Turns out, everybody knows I do it. It's one of my ""quirks"", apparently, or as somebody told me at work a few weeks ago, when I confided in her that it was a compulsion with regards to the OCD, ""I just thought you were a bit weird, haha"". Nice.  I feel like I can't express negative thoughts and feelings, because the moment it's out there, it'll come back and infiltrate me. If I put negativity out, I will only get negativity in return. I feel responsible for all the bad things that happen to me and the people around me, simply for putting negative energy out there.  I've been on this awful cycle with food of eating loads, then restricting, then eating and purging, then eating loads again and repeating the cycle. Sometimes this cycle can occur over a week, sometimes stages of the cycle (the restricting, for instance) will last several weeks. It's like I've created a goal for myself to distract my brain, to see how long I can go without food, and then I fall off and eat loads, and the cycle begins again... it's so stupid, I don't know why I do it. It's making my skin dull, and my teeth hurt, and that makes me feel ugly. No matter how many times my fiance tells me I'm beautiful, I just feel a mess. I can't see past my flaws.  When I'm alone, I tend to sit, and when it gets dark I don't turn the lights on. My fiance asked me why I tend to get so much more done when he's home, and not when I'm alone, and I couldn't explain. All I could say is ""because you're there.""  I'm paranoid all the time, about everything, and it's only getting worse. There's not a day that goes by when I don't invent scenarios, or read into things, or assume that because I hear laughter it must be aimed at me. I'm convinced my fiance will leave me, I'm convinced he wants somebody different, and the type of woman he wants in my head changes continuously, so there's literally no respite.  I can usually control it, and I've spent so long being so good at controlling it, I really got a hold of all the weird things I do and the horrible, upsetting thoughts in my head, but these last six months have been absolute hell. I went to see the doctor when I came to the end of my patience... I literally feel like I'm failing at living. I feel like I'm failing at being a person. I went from a perfect absence-free track record, over years of employment, to calling in sick three times in three months, simply because I couldn't handle leaving the house. When I saw that one of my absences had been listed as ""stress"", I felt so horribly ashamed, and instantly worried that I would lose my job or chance for promotion. I've started crying right now actually, because I'm so ashamed of myself. Why can't I just be a normal person? I'm an Assistant Manager at the moment, trying desperately to prove that I am ready for the next step, but my brain is holding me back. I know I'm good enough, my boss knows I'm good enough, but I'm failing at life and my work is beginning to suffer.  I know it's an incoherant ramble... it's just a small part of what's going on in my head, but getting it out there is a start to me working through it I guess. I just wish the Psychiatrist would get in touch. I feel so, so alone and trapped, and frightened.  Vic"

I am sorry that you are going through so much pain and feel alone trapped and frightened. First of all it is great you were able to get all that out and down on paper.Your writing isn't an incoherent ramble at all but well written and expressed! I think you have done well to cope with all that it sounds terribly hard to handle those anxieties everyday and I can see why you feel trapped with these problems and alone and frightened. So does the OCD part of your illness mainly involve keeping things spotlessly clean and doing your particular rituals?I think the people at work have accepted in the whole you do these rituals and don't think any the less of you.It is understandable you might worry different and fear about losing your job.I doubt though they want to lose you if you have been a diligent loyal employee for years. The problem with food is worrying, starving yourself for weeks is not good for your health of your emotions.Eating loads of junk food and throwing it up is really unpleasant a thing to experience. You aren't failing at life though far from it.But you have a lot of anxiety and a lot of fears which are hard to live and cope with I have had severe paranoia in the past which went away for years and returns for a while then goes again.I have it at the moment actually.I feel people are talking about me and staring at me, laughing and judging me and saying I am unacceptable, that they will reject me and think I don't deserve to be treated well.That I am a drain and a waste of their time and resources.  Vic you do have severe anxiety. It is so hard for you I know.Hopefully there are ways a psychiatrist can help.You need to know you are feeling bad because of the illness of OCD and Anxiety and the Eating disordeer, not because you are a failure or weird.With the right help and love and understanding you can get better and will feel well again.Don't worry about losing your job, it will be ok.Well done for getting this all off your chest.This is a good place this forum, you will find lots of support and help here. I hope things start getting better and with help puts you well on the way to recovery.NicolaX"

It's reassuring to hear that somebody else feels some of the things I feel, even though I wouldn't wish this on anybody, if that makes sense!  The paranoia I have is pretty much exactly like you say... always assuming that people are talking, looking, whispering. I had it really badly all through my teen years, and university, and it went away for a while, but now it's back with a vengeance! I avoid looking at people on the bus or the tube, because I worry they're judging me. It even gets to the stage where I assume my friends, loved ones and even my fiance are only around me because there's nobody else available. I isolate myself from people, so that they can't hurt me, even when they do nothing wrong. I push my fiance away because I feel angry at him for thinking bad things about me (where is my evidence for that?!), and then grasp at him and suffocate him to stop him leaving.  I think the cleaning thing is more about me focusing and distracting myself, trying to put things in order in the hope that it might somehow bring order to my brain. The worst thing for me is my thoughts. They exhaust and depress me. The purging started because I had such a build up of tension, it was making me feel ill, and I felt I had to release it.  When the therapist told me she'd spoken to her Supervisor, and they thought a Psychiatrist could provide me with what I needed better than she could, I almost wanted to sob. I almost begged her not to refer me, because I'd already waited a month to speak to her, and had been stupidly pinning my hopes on that to start sorting me out. I don't want to be left alone to deal with this myself. I'm worried I'll lose me.  Vic x"

Don't worry your family and fiance love you and will do the best they can to learn about your illness and support you.It is normal what you describe about the beating them up and blaming them and pushing them away then wanting them back and suffocating them.I think most people with mental illness have this happen and it is difficult for everyone, the same way it is for you.Over the years my family and I have had this and worked through it.They had to learn to be less controlling and insensitive and learn to acknowledge my real needs and feeling and I had to learn to handle my illness on my own and be less clinging and needy,not blaming them either.It is a learning curve but it will make you closer. I think it is usual to have a therapist pass you on to a psychiatrist, especially in view of the OCD and Eating Disorder.i think it sounds that s a serious condition that has progressed too far for you and s dangerous, so a psychiatrist would have to try and help you with that.If you think it will help though to have therapy so you can share your anxieties and not be alone with all this make sure you tell them that and hopefully they will agree you can still see someone for therapy as well as the psychiatrist. It is tiring and exhausting to have obsessive thoughts and anxieties and physically exhausting too to have both combined with an eating disorder.The fear of losing yourself is something that looms large, and with that comes the pushing of people away and the paranoia, losing yourself among people, feeling overwhelmed and a build up of tension that needs to be released are typical of anxiety disorders. Hold on and be strong and brace yourself, take shelter from the storm, it will pass and all will be well again!NicolaX"

And everytime I ate dinner i feel extremely anxious after. I lost 3 stone in a very short amount of time. I regained my eating pattern and got back to normal. I have lesser portions now but I'm eating. Well recently I've noticed my eating has gone downhill again and the last 3 days everytime I've finished my dinner I get a heart Palpitation anxiety and extreme hit flushes in my head and neck. Does anyone else get this?. I'm so scared it's all happening again.. and I don't know what to do. I've had tests done and apart from low folic acid (which I thought you only had to take while pregnant which I am not) apparently there's nothing actually wrong with me..

But as always my fear wins. One day when Ive fixed everything and it’s all sorted. I think I may have the upper hand. And I can achieve the ultimate prize. Thank you for caring. It always makes me cry when I feel someone genuinely wants to help. But help is what I need when I feel sad. Courage is what I need when I feel as I do now.

The same skill set which makes me successful at my job works against me in my private life. As I've noted, the hard-wiring of my brain is predisposed towards over-thinking/anxiety, that was compounded by my upbringing which was full of continual, unrelenting tension.

4701,Anxiety Forum,193107,At a loss,2019-01-11T18:01:06+0000,author,True,77570,London,cantcope,"Hi I am new here and I joined because nothing seems to have worked and I don't know what to do next. I'll sort of tell you my story I guess:  So basically I have a huge set of interconnected anxieties about anything and everything you can think of since I was a child e.g. work, health, sexual performance, relationships, safety, sleep, death etc. They all interfere with each other e.g. lack of sleep = tired = less work done = rubbish food to save time = poor health = death. I often find that working on one issue never works because the other issues will intervene. E.g. If I try to work on sleep, all the other anxieties will cause me to lose sleep anyway. Keeping schedules and good habits is extremely challenging when I'm exhausted from sleep deprivation all the time etc. But then trying to work on all issues at once can become overwhelming when I need to be able to focus on my PhD work. All of this affected my mood so I'm basically never happy.  I've done various forms of therapy (from ages 23-30) and none of them have really helped that much. In fact things seem to get steadily worse and new fears are always creeping in. For example, sexual performance anxiety and ED now occurs in sex with other people, AND by myself.  CBT didn't really work for me because I always found there was too much evidence to support my fears and the worst case scenario is something that I really should be concerned about. For example, for me it is evident and realistic that ED = dumping/rejection = emotional pain = everything else suffers. Or poor sleep = exhausted = life suffers = health suffers. Challenging things like that just seems like lying to yourself. Plus I found it really difficult to stick to all the homework after therapy finished.  Mindfulness has been one of the most helpful things I have done on and off for the whole time. But I find it really difficult to keep up the habit every day when my life is so chaotic and disorganized, plus I'd often fall asleep during it which kinda rendered it useless because the whole point is to be focused so you can train your mind.  I did councelling a couple of times (6 sessions each) and now I have been in psychoanalytic psychotherapy twice a week for over a year. Whilst this has been extremely useful in identifying the roots of many of my problems within my childhood, I'm still at a loss regarding what to do about it. E.g. I had like a very angry and unpredictable mum, some physical education (bit extreme on one occasion), parents' bitter divorce, bullied throughout school, racism etc. I understand how that has lead to my anxiety now. But I have no actionable steps to deal with it.  So yeah sorry about how long this is but I just wanted to get it all out there. I'm still going to be in psychoanalytic psychotherapy for another year. But I feel like I need to do something else because the help I'm getting isn't catching up with my anxiety if that makes sense. I'm worried about medication because everyone I've known who has tried it has had very bad reactions to it, e.g. making explicit plans to commit suicide and things like that. Or it just makes everything worse generally. I'm open to suggestions thought if there are any safer options. I vape CBD when it gets bad and I have tried things like valerian and passion flower extract but they aren't really long term solutions. It just seems like nothing I do works, or it's nearly impossible to manage. I'm gonna give mindfulness another go definitely though. Any ideas?  By the way my official diagnosis is generalized anxiety disorder and low-mood. That was a while ago now and I suspect I also have depression. Not sure though."

I know what you mean; you figure out all the childhood programming and then what do you do with that information ?? It still gets triggered and interferes with one's current life. It's like a foundation for a building; it's always the foundation. You can redo the exterior of the building but the foundation can't be altered.  After many years, the foundation is still there but I've learned to ignore it to some extent. It's the gradual wearing down of the program over time and this process can't be hurried. The mindfulness works because it puts you in the here and now, leaving the programming as background noise."

Did you ever struggle keeping the habit of doing mindfulness everyday? I'd often go for a few weeks doing it every day but I would always eventually fall out of it. Then eventually I'll try again, and repeat. I think when my schedule gets disorganized and I get sleep deprived its hard to be motivated to do it if I know I'll just fall asleep during. Plus if I wake up late because of my sleep pattern and I gotta run out the door for a busy day, I'll normally forget about it. I was using Headspace. Do you have any tips or advice on how to stick to it? I'm guessing you've been doing it a while."

The change in my lifestyle, the water hardness, and general pollution has caused my childhood eczema to flare up horribly. I'm 22 and haven't had any ezcema problems since I was 11.  Even though I know it's eczema and I have been to the doctor's twice to confirm it wasn't anything else contagious and they have confirmed it's eczema I cannot help but worry I have got some awful disease. I'm so concerned and worried I'm going to pass it along to my friends and family that I've stopped touching them, hugging them etc (I am very close to my friends and family and normally spend a lot of time in close contact with them) and its really affecting me.  Has anyone else dealt with this kind of worry? I haven't told any of my friends or family about it either.

I hope you are feeling a little bit better than yesterday. I'm so sorry about what you're going through. Have you tried drinking ""softer water""? I'm glad that you're doctor has confirmed that you don't have any illness and I can relate to worrying constantly about illnesses as I have a few myself and having anxiety (and Dr. Google!) doesn't help. I try to stay away from researching things I may have and I will admit that I have been to the ER a couple of times because of that. But, since you're really worried and have a really strong feeling about being ill, perhaps you can get a second opinion? You don't have to struggle alone! Please do share your concerns with your family and friends if you're comfortable, or a professional! Just don't go through it alone; it's not worth the pain! You deserve to sleep well, and to hug your family and friends!  -Reverie"

Yes I'm taking propranolol which works really well to enable me to calm my anxiety quicker. I'm just so tired of feeling this way. Plastering a fake happiness everyday is so exhausting!. And the deeper I fall into my depression my anxiety heightens. I definitely think without my depression I wouldn't have my anxiety as much.. and it would be easier to control of that makes sense.. I just don't know how to pull myself out. I know my depression kicks in more when it's that time of the month but mine are so irregular even when I don't get a normal period I still get the whole depression and cramps literally a normal period just without the bleeding..

Talking to a doctor about all of this would be a good idea and maybe they can also help find out more about your depression and anxiety. Maybe you need another medication? I know how stressful it can be when it comes to medication and finding what works for you. But it's good that the medication you're taking seems to help a bit. I know you mentioned that therapy wouldn't help with the anxiety. When did the anxiety start for you? For me, it mostly has to do with other people and it's been that way since I was a child. I can't even go outside alone because I feel like I'll have a panic attack most of the time. But maybe negative experiences in life can cause our anxiety to become worse. I hope you find out what is causing this anxiety and I hope you find the help you need!"

I get head fog and a few side affects but it's better than having full blown panic attacks. I've tried talking to my doctor and they just chuck me different pills. It's absolutely ridiculous so I don't go to the doctor's anymore. Only when I have an evaluation on my propranolol. I found out recently that you can get anxiety symptoms from having an overactive or underactive thyroid so I might get a blood test for that just to be sure as alot of my symptoms are the same as thyroid problems.. I've under gone alot of different therapy councillors and doctors and we can't seem to find out why I have anxiety. What makes me panic one day I will be fine about the next day. I got diagnosed 4 years ago. First they thought it was vertigo so gave me meds for that but it wasn't helping then when she sat me down and got me to explain everything she said she thought it sounds like anxiety. I'm sorry your going through this too it's absolutely awful!. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me. It definitely helps being able to talk to someone that knows what it's like.

I love my life here. I also love my family but my rare time spent with them proves to be my biggest trigger for anxiety. My father has come over to stay with me for a couple of weeks; it's a big trip for him and it's exciting but after one day we have run out of things to talk about.  He's a good man and I love him but our lives are completely different. And he's a one sided conversationist. While I ask him questions about his life he asks me nothing about mine; he doesn't ask about my job, my love life, my plans. Basic stuff parents should want to know. He just chats away about the minutiae of his own life and doesn't enquire about the things in my world.  This disconnection makes me feel lonely when I'm with him. And I feel my previously dormant anxiety building. I can't be my full self because so much of my life is irrelevant to him or simply does not compute. We are doing a little travel together while will be lovely but I know it will wear me out. We are related but can't relate and that's a difficult place to be when you are spending so much time in one another's company. I am trying to coax friends to come hang out with us to take the pressure off. I can't say ""hey I might just have a couple of nights of not seeing you"". That would sting and i would feel very guilty. We only see each other every couple of years. I already feel like a horrible person thinking any of this and feeling this way.  Plus I don't feel I can broach any of this with him because I know he will see me as dramatic, or difficult, and it will make everything more awkward... Because of course, I cannot change him. We are who we are and we are very different and disconnected.  I want to give my dad the experiences he deserves, but without wearing myself out in the process. Any tips for how to control my anxiety so I can be a better daughter?"

Help?,2015-04-13T07:25:57+0100,replier,False,17334,UK,AliceinWonderland,"People like that are wearing to be with, whether they're family or not. You're very kind, and dutiful, to want to make it a good trip for him, but don't neglect your own needs in all this. You're right, you're unlikely to change him, but personally I think you'd be quite a saint to tolerate two weeks of him showing no interest in your life, and him talking endlessly about the minutiae of his. I think you should spend time doing your own thing for the sake of your wellbeing, I don't think that's unreasonable at all, you shouldn't be expected to drop everything cos he's staying. And yes, invite others along to spend time with you if you can. And spend time on the phone with people who are interested in you and your life, and who you can chat to and offload to.  I am concerned you are putting what you feel he 'deserves' above what you deserve. Why does he deserve to be endlessly listened to and shown a nice time, whilst you don't deserve to have any interest shown in your life and the things that are important to you? I have to limit time spent with people like this, or my mental health suffers (and yes, it's my parent too, so can't be totally avoided). So, as you've no choice about it being a whole fortnight, I'd advise as many short breaks out of his company as you can manage. Even if it means making up excuses like a friend in need of a visit, or something you need to go out and buy. You never know, he might also appreciate a bit of time to himself.  I do feel for you, it hurts when a parent doesn't show that interest in their child's life that would be normal and expected. I think it's important to recognise that there's likely to be a loss and a sadness about that, and a hurt and an anger sometimes.  But I can't stress enough that your needs, and your mental health are important in all this. Please try to get what you need out of this visit, not let it all be about him. Good luck"

He kicked off after I said to him your stuck in times like my grand father is, meaning you are stuck in a regiment time how people used to be in the war. His parents only eat around 4-5pm every day. So he could only book a meal out with his parents yesterday at 6pm. He had Monday and Tuesday off because it was a Birthday week for him to have a break from work.  Sunday evening, it was hugely hot and stuffy in his bedroom that he had the fan on all night and that disturbed my sleep. So I got up and tried to open the windows with venetican blinds hiding the handles, I moaned and said ""Oh I will do it then, open the window because it isn't open!"" I would of thought it would of been open all of them were closed and my nose was so stuffy I couldn't breathe. It was just a normal reaction and not in a nasty tone. He flipped and thought it was personal towards him and got moody about it, the next morning he changed and said you had a go at me, I said excuse me? he said about the window! I was asleep and you were nasty! I said it's a fucking window are you insane? and he got up early in the morning and stopped speaking to me.  So petty arguments over a window being shut in the night, a toilet seat being up always and the restricted times he gets up, eats and goes to bed, even on a day off he had 3 and the weekend free and he still had to ""stick"" to times.  Is that something to do with OCD? he suffers from Anxiety and maybe I am guessing Paranoia too because he gets the wrong end of stick with everything I say, he takes offence easily and turns the situation on to me like I am the bad one that's been nasty.  He has done drugs in the past and he did them 2 months ago but only coke so I think. He have never done the hard drugs, though I think they have had a big massive affect on his brain as he doesn't understand what I say or other people say he gets very defensive and moody. He has also turned off the WIFI in the evening so I don't use my phone plus it saves money turning it off? or is that a way to control me? he said your on your phone too much which I am not and he said you need to watch the Documentry about Social Media taking over people's lives. I said no I don't saw it I got bored, I was on it because I was watching a makeup programme and this girl was on Instagram.  Is that normal behaviour?"

There must be some good in him, or something appealing about him, that attracted you to him and keeps you two together. If he is always like this then no, it's not normal behavior. He could have a behavioral problem stemming from some kind of disorder. But no one knows for sure until he's evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist. Try to talk him into seeing a doctor. If he refuses and keeps up the verbal abuse, then it may be time to reexamine your relationship with him to determine if you should get out of an unhealthy relationship. All of this must be taking a toll on you."

I think the Tarot reader mistaken it for a family connection as he has a very close bond with his sister and they meet up on a regular basis without me being there. I have only met her once 4 years ago, we got back together 6 weeks ago and I've met his parents 3 times but not met her. So it did give me a thought who is she, is he meeting his sister as I haven't met her. Just think it's an odd relationship they have. He said it's like she's my best friend and that they have a ""weird"" relationship, it's like she is his mother because they don't feel close to their own mother. So they have each other. If I met her around the same time it wouldn't of occurred to me something was ""off"" only due to him not being very sexual towards me and avoiding talking about sex with me. That's when I booked a tarot reading as there was speculations of my own anxiety around it.  Am I being paranoid?  I don't believe he has cheated or seeing anyone he's more of a hermit and in the bedroom he has a lower sex drive than me.  A few weeks ago his bango from his frenium snapped during sex, prob not using enough lube and he had an accident he told his sister everything! and that shook me as that was personal?"

I took it to calm down my mind and to stop the repetitive thinking, it worked straight away and by that time I had to come off it the next day. Since the last three weeks I don't dare drive on the motorway anymore in case I re think of a bad inappropriate thought and then that is when my brain zap happens. It's like I shake everywhere from my mind to my arms and hands and then my performance of driving is out of control.  I never had a experience like this ever since I took that shitty pill and now I can't drive long distances! I am the only child I am 34 years old, my Mum has no understanding of my condition and doesn't want to know either! I told her OCD is a psychiatric disorder and she then said ""your mad basically"" ""get help and get sorted, stop moaning!"" I had to take 2-3 months off my own work to support my mum, dress her after her fall of her broken arm. I took care of her business etc before I took this pill! I was driving everywhere and this is the SUPPORT I get BACK from her! how ungrateful is SHE? I am fuming, she has ruined my day today, I was having a good day and she's ruined it again by hoping she was helping by giving me a book to get me taking more vitamins and changing my diet and I am suddenly going to get back on track? I said a fucking book does no justice and doesn't solve the fucking problem of OCD.  Sorry to rant on! I only have one friend who understands what I am going through! and it hurts to know my own shitty mum can't help me or understand what I am going through! I would prefer to just die and get rid of this problem I have as it's totally changed me completely!  I saw a therapist last week and I spent £85 for 50 minutes I asked for CBT it was almost like a counciling session, I had to talk about my past relationships and how I was as a child etc. I never got any help for what I was suffering from other than fill out this sheet for your thoughts and feelings. I have seen two therapists and have wasted £145 and have had no benefit for my health. So basically I am fucked at the moment for money and seeking help other than waiting for weeks on end for free help from the NHS. Plus the last therapist never diagnosed me properly so I am going to be leaving her a bad negative review!  I don't know what else to do! Are these therapists that do text messaging services on betterhelp sort of websites good? are they powerful as seeing someone on skype or in person?  Thanks x"

I think the increase should have had an effect by now as you had a lot in your system already, but obviously, I am not an expert. I think if its not working then ask about another drug to help you.

I been under a lot of stress the last year from a lot of different factors .. and after one big stressful event I seemed to lose my appetite over night and haven’t really had it since it’s been over 3 weeks now .. I’m burping a lot more and having a lot of stomach gurgling and sometimes a vague pain in lower abdomen .. the first 2 weeks I never ate much and had the odd dinner here and there and have noticed I’ve lost about 10 lbs so far in 3 weeks I’ve been drs twice and had full blood count and liver function tests ect all come back in good range dr thinks anxiety but I’m worried as still not hungry and the digestive issues and weight loss .. could this actually be down to anxiety ? Thanks Jeremy
4790,Anxiety Forum,327713,Sudden anxiety,2020-10-29T12:01:43+0000,replier,False,92994,london,WanderingA,Yes it is! Unfortunately i had the same. I have major issues with eating normally I go like a few days not being that hungry then it'll pick up again but I went 6 months not eating properly. I felt hungry but when I ate I felt sick and had no craving for any type of foods. Over the last month my appetite is coming back. Very slowly but its getting there.. I get random cravings for food here and there or some days I forget to eat and it makes my anxiety worse.. I suggest try and get some very plain foods down you also fruit veg to keep healthy. Unfortunately it's a massive circle cause you don't eat cause your not hungry but you need to goodness from the foods otherwise you can't function properly and it can make anxiety so much worse. Try take some vitamins too found them helpful as some days I ate just one sandwich and that would be it.. I lost over 2 stone not eating. For me it's a good thing as I am slightly overweight and I do feel healthier now but don't get into the whole not eating as its really hard to try come back from that. Just like when you have the flu or are unwell eat little and often bigger meals will put you off eating even more..
4791,Anxiety Forum,327713,Sudden anxiety,2020-10-29T12:02:16+0000,replier,False,79503,UK,Lunar Lady,"Welcome @Jeremysmith1987  Yes, stress and anxiety can make your appetite disappear. When a stressful event happens to us, our hormone levels change and the body produces far more cortisol than usual. Our stomachs then have to produce far more acid to counteract the cortisol...so we can end up with digestive issues.  It would be a good idea to keep a food diary of what you're eating every day. Your doctor can then see your calorie intake and decide if further investigation is needed. Meanwhile, eat little and often so your digestive system isn't stressed. x"

This in itself isn't unusual- he seems to suffer from insomnia and difficult sleep patterns. I found him in the office with a bottle of Bailey's looking extremely pissed. Asked if he was ok. He's ok although slurring a lot so he's been drinking since I went to bed at 11pm. This has become a recurring pattern. Used to be occasional, maybe once a month. Lately seems to be more often. We don't have any plans tomorrow so he's not done anything wrong as such or let anyone down. We don't have kids either so not an issue with responsibility. So why does it upset me so much? I don't feel comfortable with it and it's making me feel really uneasy. I don't feel good at all and now can't go back to sleep. I feel like it's not normal and can just imagine if this was revealed to any friends they'd feel sorry for me. Of course I don't know that this doesn't go on behind their closed doors, but to me it's weird/immature. Am I over thinking this? Why is it affecting me so much?"

It seems like it’s becoming a problem that you maybe can talk about when he is sober. In the end he will have to decide whether he thinks he has a problem. There are support groups and counselors for people living with an alcoholic so you can talk about how it’s affecting you. Take care of yourself and you are not overthinking this. It’s normal to worry about someone you love getting lost in substance abuse.

Even though they didn't have those same beliefs only 5 years ago, I feel like everyone changes their beliefs just because their social circle is doing so as well, I feel like no one around me can think for themselves. They're more concerned with the emotions surrounding their beliefs rather than if they truly believe and think its true or not. I'm naturally a skeptical person so I question literally everything, I get anxious about everything, I second guess everything, why am I an awful person for this? People say they support people with mental health issues but as soon as you do or say anything out of place you're evil. For example I don't believe a man can be a woman regardless of what he personally believes. If gender is a construct why am I evil for having a different conception of this construct? After all gender at its essence is basically meaningless now for these people. Why is not believing you any different from me not believing in Catholicism for example? But you will all think I'm a bad person for thinking this for example. I just don't understand people. Why can't I have my own opinions? This causes me great anxiety. I think I'm right to isolate myself from everyone. I manage to infuriate everyone for being myself. My account will be deleted soon so I might not respond. It's a shame no one likes me and everyone thinks Im rude because I have no one else to talk to now so I guess I will stay alone and keep everything to myself like society clearly wants me to do, they want me to be their slave that agrees with everything they say"

Can your case manager or someone at the mental health center you are associated with intervene and explain to the doctor your situation so it is taken more seriously? Alternatively I’d ask if you can leave a message for your doctor to call you back. I doubt any doctor would want their patients going off their meds as a result of their negligence. If you are in this situation your doctor needs to know."

What you need to remember is the system is imperfect. When you know you can't stop medication and a receptionist tells you there are no appointments, you need to take action by being a pain in the backside until they listen to you. It's rarely the doctor's fault. Go there, phone them, remind them of your situation. Don't take ""3 weeks"" as an acceptable answer. Sadly the system is under strain and people are not always seen in order of priority. Make yourself a priority and you can usually find a way. Well done in getting your prescription though. Good work! Dan."

I am currently serving a mission for the LDS (mormon) church and I am suffering. I originally was not going to go but my parents encouraged me and I met a girl who had just gotten back who wanted me to go. We ended up dating and I care deeply about her so being apart from her is tearing me apart. I have been a missionary for a little over 2 months but have been away from my house for only about a week. I know the best thing for me to do is to stay here, my girlfriend wants me to get this experience and there will be more opportunities for us if i stay, but it is by far the hardest thing I have had to do. I am only allowed to call twice a week and only my parents, I have been breaking the rules to message my friends for support but my girlfriend has stopped messaging me because she wants me to focus on working, she is doing what she thinks is best for me but it still feels awful. I had a massive anxiety attack two days ago and the only thing that got me through it was hoping the next person I was partnered with had no desire to work so that I could just gather myself. Shortly after I had those thoughts I felt an immense guilt, my girlfriend had done this and she knew what she was doing was right, she did what she said she was going to do, I on the other hand have changed my beliefs back and forth so many times that it is pathetic. I am not as religious as my parents and the people here but I still believe in some things, however last night I became convinced that God is going to tell my girlfriend to leave me because I am not a good person and not focused. I realized yesterday that I am just not as good a person as she is, it is almost like I can feel God telling her she should be with someone else. I texted my mom (also against the rules and I had to sneak away to do it) that I feel like i am in Hell, if there is a hell I cannot imagine it feels different than this. I found myself yesterday hoping with every fiber of my being that somehow I would walk downstairs and i would be alone in the world so I could just be by myself and not even think but just be there, of course that is ridiculous so I went back downstairs and continued on working. I fear so much that my girlfriend will leave me, she makes we want to be a better person and I cannot see another future without her. Everyday has been the same battle where I think i need to be here and then get slammed down by my emotions and wonder why it is so hard. Is it because I am just an evil person? I really have no idea, but I am burning myself out and I am getting close to the point where I am just numb and feelingless. I know that this is a very specific case and I do not even know if it is worth the time to read but if you do have some advice or any thoughts please help me."

Just remember you're doing this now and you'll be able to reap the benefits in the long run. Its totally ok to be feeling how your feeling. It sounds a bit like you're out of your comfort zone.  Also it is fine that you're not as religious as your family. You are your own person. I'm not heavily religious. I'm very open-minded about it. But if there is a God, they wouldn't put you on this earth without knowing you are going to make mistakes. Life is all about learning and experiences, being kind, hopeful, and accepting. You're not a bad person at all, you're just conflicted. You're girlfriend is lucky to have someone like you who is trying their absolute best to do the right thing for the relationship, its clear you love her so much. She would be a fool to leave you.  Heres what I would if I was you:  If you can write a journal with how you are feeling. Another thought, write a journal of things you would like to say to your girlfriend and it would also make a nice gift for when you see her again.  Breathe and ground yourself. Think of the positive things that can come out of this.  Cry it out if you need to. Never hold any feelings in, it'll make you feel overwhelmed.  Find a way to enjoy what youre going through.  Reflect on what makes you happy.  Have you bought your girlfriend a promise ring yet?....  and finally think about yourself: “You always have to remember to take care of you first and foremost, because when you stop taking care of yourself, you get out of balance and you really forget how to take care of others.”  I really hope this helps!"

Why do I still let it upset me, consume me and overwhelm me from time to time.

4855,Anxiety Forum,279921,Are these anxiety attacks?,2020-04-23T00:36:02+0100,author,True,90185,London,darktolight,"When I was young, I pretty much only cried when I got physically hurt. As an adult, I go years without shedding a single tear. However, there have been several throughout my life where I remember suddenly starting to cry very intensely for long periods and not knowing why. The first time was when I was 4.  Each time I would shake, hyperventilate/struggle to breathe with a choking feeling, my heart would race, and I would feel weird, like very aware of my skin or my skin being rigid or having intense goosebumps. Hard to explain.  Recently looking back I realised that in nearly all of them I had a strong feeling of fear of being abandonment or feeling deep inescapable discomfort but I didn't realise it at the time, just felt very strongly ""off"". I'm pretty sure I have (quiet) BPD/cPTSD tendencies which might explain the abandonment feelings.  About half of the instances, that I can remember, occurred when I would see that I had gotten my period (the first few years when I first started menstruating and it was very irregular) which I always assumed must be something hormonal. I'm not afraid of blood and wasn't afraid of getting my period but somehow something about it was too much to handle. Apart from this, I've never had much PMS, aside from getting a little mild grumpiness the first day it comes.  Looking at panic/anxiety attack symptoms, I don't seem to match all of the symptoms but I'm not sure if this is regular crying or not. Are these anxiety attacks? Or something else?  (I know a doctor or therapist is best to discuss this with I'd like to get a general consensus first).  Thanks"

This is quite a complex thing I've stressed about for a long time, I'll try and be concise.  Basically, I have this ongoing issue with my group of friends from school (who I've been friends with for about 15 years). I love them dearly and I'm glad they're in my life, but sometimes I feel like there is a negative or ""toxic"" (although that words a bit strong) aspect to the relationship, and I don't know if its based in reality or if I'm just over-thinking/being over-sensitive.  I feel like sometimes they scrutinise my behaviour, or decisions I make, or past mistakes I've made in a way that they don't do to each other, or in a way that I wouldn't do to them. Sometimes I also feel like the butt of every joke, or that I'm a joke to them. Obviously we're a group of friends and we slag each other off at times, but for some reason I can't help but feel like I get the brunt of it - Sometimes I doubt myself though.  It confuses me because it's really different to other friend-group dynamics I'm in. I have other friends outside of that group that sometimes feel way more positive / uplifting.  The other part of this problem is that sometimes in other groups I'm in I sometimes feel the same way, just to a lesser extent. It's almost like sometimes I want to ask people like ""What is it about me that is inviting this? Like, do I give the impression of being a really confident person that can take it?"" because I just always feel kind of picked on at times, and I feel like I'm going crazy constantly doubting myself if I'm just imagining it. Can anyone relate?"

Click to expand...  Is this a group of “Mean Girls” you are hanging around with? If yes you might not be able to expect better of them. Their inappropriate and cutting behaviors are destructive to your sense of self esteem, period. Friend are supposed to support each other, not cut each other down. You are being reasonable in wanting to stand up for yourself and I recommend it. The next time something happens let them know that you do not appreciate it and those choices are interfering with your relationship. If they say too bad they are not changing, you know to ditch them. If they apologize they have a chance of improving the situation. You do have to talk about it with them, though, because they might not be aware of how much this toxic behavior hurts you. Good luck!"

David Cameron is attacking the poor once again by targeting council homes to be demolished, its already happened to many. David Cameron says for every council home that gets knocked down 2 to 3 new starter homes can be built in the same space?  That sounds terrible perfectly good built council homes will be replaced by little glass boxes built on the cheap for people to buy. I can't believe this is allowed to happen.  Some people who have bought their council homes under the right to buy are also losing there home and getting one of the new cheap nasty little boxed starter homes in exchange. David Cameron says people who have bought there council home will be awarded 400 pounds in compensation the same applies for permanent council tennents.  Those newly built starter homes have no value to them at all. The council and housing associations are currently being encouraged to sell off their properties and that the council gets to keep the money on the homes they sell.  I really hope people don't vote for Torys again otherwise thats it for social housing.  I'm going to be real mad if I find that my home is on there list. They will have to knock it down with me inside it. I just can't see myself living in a tiny little depressing box."

I've gone through quite a lot mentally over the past couple years. One thing I find really difficult/almost impossible at times, is just managing conflict and disagreements in relationships and standing up for myself. For years I used to go with the flow. I would say sorry just to end the argument, even if I felt I hadn't done anything wrong. And I would never be assertive if there was an issue that was bothering me.  Now, I don't have that problem so much. Last year I was able to walk away from a really unhealthy group of friends, and set some boundaries with my family. But sometimes I still feel so confused.  It sometimes feels like if I take issue with the way someone is speaking to me, or treating me, there is always an excuse. It's always my behaviour that caused it. It's always my fault. So therefore I should be the one that apologises. Which I don't get, because I admit I'm not perfect but I would never intentionally hurt someone, and generally speaking I'm not confrontational or aggressive. So I guess it gets under my skin when I feel like someone treats me that way.  Last year one of my former friends was being extremely controlling and passive aggressive toward me. She was jealous if I was hanging out with friends more than her, she was constantly badgering at me and making passive aggressive comments. When I finally confronted her about it her response was just to blame me and I even ended up apologising to end the conversation because I felt so uncomfortable. We ended up going a few months without speaking. She eventually messaged me saying that she missed me, she loved me and relied on me for her happiness. I took a few days to think it over and think what to say, being mindful of the fact she didn't seem particularly stable. I reiterated the issues that had bothered me, and also said I still needed space and time to myself. Within a couple hours she replied, accusing me of gas-lighting her and then blocking me before I could even type a response.  The other day my boyfriend and I also got into an argument. He was annoyed that there were housework things I hadn't done. When he spoke to me about it he immediately seemed to have an attitude, and whereas I would normally ask him more politely like ""Oh, would you mind doing X, Y, Z,"" etc, it was as if he was scolding a child and he got really irate over it. It caught me off-guard so it took me a minute to kind of hold my hands up and say okay, yeah, my bad, I'll do better. But when I said by the way I really don't like being spoken to that way, and in future can you just be a bit more calm/polite, he just blamed me and was like well, it all built up because you hadn't done X, Y, Z.... And he said he knows he can get worked up at times and I was making him feel bad for pointing out that it bothered me. And I'm just like urghhhhh what even is the point anymore? What is even the point in me saying to someone to not treat me that way, or not speak to me that way, if I just get blamed?  And even in more straight forward situations I get confused. Like let's say if I got into a disagreement with someone or if I realised that I'd messed up and made a mistake and apologised. It's almost like in my head I'll start ruminating like ""Oh, well if I was in the wrong in that situation, what if I've been in the wrong in other situations? What if I'm the bad one?"" etc. and it just goes on and on in a loop.  Please help."

I also hate confrontation and will stay quiet or walk away from certain interactions, even if deep down I know I haven't done or said anything wrong. I've come to accept that's the way I am and can't make myself into something I'm not. Don't know how long you've been with your boyfriend but my advice would be that, if you love him and want to continue the relationship, you should talk about these things, because otherwise they build up into resentment. I've been married for over 20 years, I've taken responsibility for a lot of shit that wasn't my fault, and as a result anything we once felt for each other died many years ago. I thought this was my lot, trapped in a toxic relationship for the rest of my life. But now I've decided I deserve something better, I've always tried to do my best for other people, whether known to me or complete strangers. So I'm moving out, flying solo and trying to stop feeling guilty all the time. Nothing could save my relationship, but hopefully yours has a future."

If the response to you trying to clear the air was to block you, I mean. Especially if that friend was aware of how difficult you find it to fight your corner. You sound a bit like me, a people pleaser. Therapy made me look far back, to see where it all started, and this is something that began at a very early age, trying to please others because I was never enough. These days I try to look after myself a bit better, but still find it very hard to stand up for myself. Take care of yourself and yeah, if your relationship with your boyfriend is otherwise going well, try not to leave arguments unresolved, even if they're just about chores. I just ended up becoming resentful because I wouldn't express my opinions in order to avoid conflict."

We had been very happy so it was a difficult sudden blow. I told him I would be there for him but avoided contacting him for a month, to give him space. I realised his depression was not helped by my constant need for contact with him, and I used the time to explore why I felt such deep attachment, and why I couldn't handle the break up very well. After a month I felt clearer and got in touch. We've met up a few times since then, as friends, and he said he really values me as an ally. He clearly cares about me, and I still care about him, but he's going away travelling for 4 months to figure himself out. So I know I just have to be a friend right now. When we're together we're very close, and we both obviously enjoy being together, as friends if nothing more, but when we part ways I have a panic attack. I am short of breath, want to cry, want to be near him again, and cannot work out why I like this. I'm a reasonable and independent person, I don't feel jealous or suspicious of him but this clearly looks like attachment anxiety. We're meeting up one more time before he goes travelling and I just don't know how I will handle that ensuing panic attack. It's taken weeks to get to a therapist via my GP so that won't happen until the new year. I don't want to push this man away by revealing any of my symptoms so am just trying to ride out the feelings alone. How can I get over this?"

I think you will benefit by exploring your feelings with your new therapist. You can talk on here as a distration when you panick or start obsessively thinking and can't break out of it. My current boyfriend and I hated each other when we first met over 25 years ago and he was dating another past friend of mine but we became friends over time, We discovered an attraction for each other when I broke up with my last long term boyfriend and he was boarding temporarily, we formed a relationship and he moved in. It was a disaster, we fought, lived completely differently to one another and annoyed the crap out of each other. We broke up for a year then got back together as the feelings and attractions were still strong, there is a real love between us. Now we work famously together as long as we keep our own places and give each other lots of space. I know my PTSD interferes with my relationships and he has some kind of adhd and can rage time to time which is very triggering for me. We did find ways to work around it though, It may not be an old school conventional relationship but it works for us and we're quite happy as two independant adults with independant lives. I hope you find a way to work things to both of your advantages with your friend/boyfriend."

How can I get over this?  There's your issue.  There is no such thing as pushing a man away by feeling anxiety or feeling upset or being hurt or whatever. Would you be pushed away if he was feeling anxious, upset, etc? You obviously haven't been pushed away by his depression.  People do not leave you because you are unhappy. Or rather, healthy, happy people do not leave you because you are unhappy. That goes for friends and boyfriends.  I have one foot in ambivalent attachment as well. I also don't have any problems with jealousy or suspicion and in fact don't have problems of needing to be inappropriately close in the relationship - I'm happy for others to have their independence - but my reaction to breakups can be extraordinary (and, for me, embarrassing) - and the reason for it is shame:  ""There's something wrong with me, further evidenced by this extreme reaction, I can't let them find out because they'll hate me for it/I'm too much/I have issues/I'm crazy/other people shouldn't have to cope with me...""  ^^That there is what ambivalent attachment means. It's about shame and about believing, at some level, that you are unwanted (because you 'need too much'). In reality, ambivalently attached people were given the impression early on in life that they needed too much and were ashamed to need their parents (they had the same needs as other children, but their parents were unable to meet those needs in a consistent manner, giving the child the impression that they were 'too needy' and that they would be rejected for being too needy). This continues in your mind into adulthood and plays itself out.  You have said in your message you feel your boyfriend's depression was deepened by your need for him - why would that make someone depressed? I just want you to ask yourself that, because most people do not feel depressed when someone wants to be around them. They feel wanted. Most people actually find it flattering - unless this was a case where you were phoning him several times a day? And are you sure you wanted to be inappropriately close? Or did he want to be inappropriately distant? (Make sure you don't take whatever he says is 'normal' as the truth)  You are now saying that he will reject you if he sees any need in you - if you appear too anxious or too upset by the idea of losing him. Do you think it is inappropriate to feel anxious and upset about not seeing someone you are in love with? I would say it is 100% absolutely healthy and completely normal to be upset about that. Allow yourself to be upset about that, you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. And believe me when I say that it is shame that is causing every symptom you have (if it really is an attachment issue).  Sorry if this doesn't actually reflect your life, I'm guessing by the words you've used somewhat"

Thank you so much - you really hit the nail on the head. Just reading that makes me feel I understand myself a little better. I do question my worth, and think my anxiety and 'neediness' is a weakness. I have always thought needing anyone else is weak: that's something I once learned through previous therapy (back before any of this anxiety came about).  And you are so right in all your points about hiding my feelings away, and taking a more realistic perspective. I always assumed it was my neediness that made things worse: he found it hard to respond to me all the time and I in turn, looking back, was always impatient for a response.. Although in hindsight he also told me he couldn't give me the reassurance he felt I deserved, because he was so inside his own head with his depression. I forget about that: in fact, even he felt I was justified in my needs; he was just unable to meet them. But I fear if I tell him about my anxiety and my feelings, that he will take it as proof that being with him just causes me pain (all part of his view that he's not good to be with) or feel it's another pressure to handle, when all he really wants to do is withdraw and be alone.  If he wasn't going away travelling in a couple of weeks' time I would broach this more with him and perhaps see if he wanted to try things again after a little while. But I now have to sit on my hands and think carefully about what I want to say to him. To be honest, I would love to get back together with him but the timing is just all wrong. And that is all part of why I panic I think. I know he's going away and knowing this, I want to be with him all the time.

I have always thought needing anyone else is weak Oh me too. When I first read about attachment theory, I assumed I was avoidant because the list of 'things avoidant people relate to' sounded exactly like me: Independence is extremely important, needing others is weak etc. etc. But these are actually also the things ambivalent people think - perhaps more so.  all part of his view that he's not good to be with I am not in any way criticising him, but the truth is that right now at this moment, he's right about that. You can have compassion for him and understand his depression and his inability - right now - to be able to provide for others. I'm not asking you to be angry or to hate him for that (I'm sure you'd find that impossible) because it's absolutely not his fault. But unfortunately, it does mean that right now he is not able to provide you with what you need to be happy. And what you need to be happy is not 'too much', as he has attested himself. In your heart wish him the best and hope he finds happiness in the future, but also recognise that you do deserve someone who is capable of meeting your needs and capable of providing a fulfilling relationship.

The obsession is horrible and I wind up wasting all my energy on thinking about us, and him, rather than me.  Understandable, but keep moving those thoughts back to yourself every time you find yourself thinking of him. What's really going to make you feel better?  There are a couple of trends among ambivalent folks like you and I. Firstly, a sense of powerlessness - a sense of feeling trapped, stuck, controlled, helpless. As if no matter what you will not get what you want from life. Accept this is not true. Sit down with yourself and work out what you want from life and then make it your pact with yourself that you are going to go out there and do that right now. What do you want for your career? What do you want from your hobbies? How do you envisage yourself loving life separate to your boyfriend? (And you're just going to have to trust that this is possible) Work out what it is - and dream big - and then go out there and do that thing. If it seems overwhelming, work out what steps you can take to approach it in small chunks and, no matter how you feel, force yourself forward into it. When you recognise yourself having thoughts or feelings that are upsetting, do not judge yourself for them, you have not failed. Just be aware they are there and tell yourself 'oh, I'm thinking about that again' and gently shift your attention. If it's an emotion, say to yourself 'I'm feeling ____, but emotions wane if I let them and don't fight them and I can cope with this. I will feel ok again soon'. Allow your thoughts, allow your feelings, do not ever judge yourself for them, and gently shift your attention to something fulfilling or enjoyable because you deserve that.  The other trend among ambivalent folk is to believe they are incompatible with most people - they tend to at some deep level believe love is rare, and they also tend to have a hard time believing they can be happy with anyone but this one person.  There are two reasons for this. Firstly, love was actually rare for you when you were growing up. It is totally rational for your brain to have learned that this is true. Fortunately, it's not. There are millions of people out there for you. It's difficult to believe that right now but accept it is true and keep reminding yourself of that fact. Also accept it is difficult for you to believe - and this is 100% normal for absolutely everybody out there in your situation. But recognise that in three months time you will not believe he is the only man out there anymore.  The second reason you are stuck on him is because the only way you can rid yourself of shame is to be accepted despite what you believe are 'shameful flaws' (neediness etc.). Another person accepting you, in your head, would not wipe away that shame. Only him accepting you would wipe away that shame. Recognise this thought pattern and remind yourself that none of this is your fault and that he does accept you just as you are, he just also realises that he cannot be in a relationship right now and he needs to focus on himself. You need to focus on yourself too.  Be very, very kind to yourself. It's difficult if you're in the habit of self-shaming, so don't beat yourself up if you find it hard. Just recognise when you're doing it and gently shift your attention and keep repeating to yourself that you have nothing to be ashamed of."

It's amazing how lost you can be in your own head when in the throes of anxiety. I look forward to feeling clearer as time goes on.  Well done, you're doing really well But remember that 'attachment panic' is not a mystifying illness that will take over, you should become attached to partners, it's very important that you do. It's completely, utterly normal. And it sounds to me that your partner was a nice guy that has apologised for not being able to be there for you in a normal, healthy way.  Normally, attachment problems come about when one of these is true: a) One partner is 'against' attachment to another (feels engulfed by normal levels of attachment/intimacy, dislikes being emotionally close with others) b) One partner believes they have very few options for love, so believes this is their only chance c) One partner takes rejection or potential rejection personally due to beating themselves up (if I were a better person this person would have accepted me - it is because of me that I am not with that person)  This all boils down to how we feel about ourselves and what lessons we have learned about love and attachment from our parents. The one time I had a break-up that completely floored me is completely logical and rational when you see it from my point of view (in the context of my experiences).  I had been in many relationships, left most of them, been left once (felt bad, but not overwhelmingly so, when left, and judged myself for feeling bad, believing it showed weakness).  The next relationship I was in, I felt bad immediately because I felt dependent due to overwhelming feelings of shame that I couldn't resolve unless accepted by him. This feeling went away pretty quickly but came back when he turned out to actually care about my feelings and say nice things to me about how felt about me, and tell me he missed me when I wasn't there. His face lit up when I entered the room, etc. It was like I actually mattered to someone and it was the first and only time I had felt that there was something about me that was valued.  The end of that relationship completely destroyed me because in my experience, that's not what relationships were like. I genuinely - utterly - believed that it was not normal for someone to feel that way about me or to treat me that way - to actually care about me and my welfare - until very recently. For years, I believed that relationship was different from all other relationships and that there was something between me and him that could not be repeated.  Now, I am rather demonstrably not stupid and not irrational. Rationality, in fact, is something I love above all else (to a degree others find frankly irritating), but it is in fact perfectly rational for me, given my experiences, to not recognise that someone valuing me should be normal. The reason I was so destroyed and the reason it took me six years (yep) to get over that breakup was firstly because I didn't believe it would ever happen again (I once told a therapist I thought this was utterly unrealistic and stupid and I meant it) and because the extreme emotions I experienced during the breakup, which made me behave desperately and in a burdensome way that I'm not proud of (not made better by my parents' reaction: one to tell me he probably left just so he could be as far away from me as possible (not true, by the way, we did actually get on extremely well and there weren't relationship issues as much as mental health issues on both sides) and the other phoned me up with what I can only assume was a pre-written list of all of my 'failures' over the last year, which he reeled off to me in order to 'motivate me'). In hindsight, I'm not surprised I was destroyed.  I then perpetuated my beliefs over those six years by accepting relationships with men who a) I didn't care about and didn't love and b) didn't show any care or love towards me. I wasn't just being a dick, I genuinely believed that's what life was like and that it would be unrealistic to have any higher expectations. I even thought it was unrealistic I would meet someone I found physically attractive, but now I accept that isn't true, because I've met two people I found attractive this year, although neither was a good match for me personality wise.  Nowadays, I understand that I deserve to be valued and that people valuing me or accepting me for who I am and actually caring about my welfare and feelings. I'm also coming around to the idea that as there is nothing particularly different about me, there will be people I find attractive, and some of them will have a personality well-suited to mine.  These are the kinds of beliefs that perpetuate attachment problems - and that's all an attachment issue is, a set of beliefs that are perfectly rational considering your experience, because no matter how intelligent or how thoughtful you are, if you've never experienced normal or healthy, you have no idea what it looks like.  One of the first things I would encourage is not to judge yourself by your feelings. You haven't actually said anything here that says to me 'attachment issues'. You have said you are upset by your boyfriend leaving you. What do you think would be the healthy response? Indifference? I would be alarmed if you were not upset by the breakdown of a relationship with someone you love. But you sound like you know you will love someone again and that you will begin to feel better about this soon, which tells me you do not have attachment issues. Believe me, six years ago, I would have been writing that it was impossible for me to ever meet someone like that again and that he had set the bar too high. Others would have told me it was ridiculous to say that, and I would have thought 'well, they would say that, they don't understand that our relationship wasn't like other relationships, it's so rare they can never have experienced it', because in my world, being loved was rare. Do you see what I mean?  So I guess what I'm saying, is that you don't sound anywhere near as bad as I was, and having read a load about preoccupied/ambivalent attachment, I'm nowhere near as bad as most (I don't recognise or relate to the vast majority of feelings, thoughts and behaviours that are associated with the preoccupied), so while I absolutely encourage you to have therapy - because if you feel in your gut that you need help then you should absolutely do that and you're obviously a great candidate for therapy because you are so insightful and motivated to feel better - I also want you to know that there is nothing terribly wrong with you. I see no evidence of that, anyway.  You're going to do great. I've managed to get through life so far without too much of a hiccup - although, yeah, plenty of hiccups along the way - and I was in a much worse position than it sounds like you are, with much more extreme beliefs. I wish I had been you at your age, I really do, there's a lot of hope here"
4932,Anxiety Forum,101626,Friendship with ex: attachment anxiety causing panic attacks,2015-01-04T18:21:49+0000,author,False,40187,London,jojeba,"Thanks again for your wonderful and generous rationality and insight. I suppose the behaviour that makes me believe I have attachment issues is the extreme panic I feel when not around my ex - hard to breathe, obsessing, etc. I decided to write him a letter with a lot of heartfelt advice for him while he was away working on himself (asking him to be kind to himself, to let him know that while he probably won't want to communicate with anyone that he can always reach me, etc) - and I wrote that letter about 50 times before I got it perfect. Which doesn't sound much but I even spent a whole day just writing that letter over and over. It is obsessive behaviour which doesn't seem to fit into any other part of my life and feels so new and scary. It's only about this particular person, and I think it's because we did have this connection based upon our hidden weaknesses. As if we both saw in the other things that nobody else saw, and we leaned on each other.  Deep down I know I will meet someone again but I find the idea of even kissing someone else horrifying and uncomfortable - not because I don't crave affection or because I'm not interested in being physical with anyone else, but because I still have feelings for my ex. It was, ironically, my shortest relationship yet the most intense and therefore it is proving to be my hardest break-up. Last night I went by his house to drop off the letter I wrote, and we were both clearly finding it difficult to deal with the whole situation. It was awkward and weird, and when I left, he practically hid in the other room... Only as I was about to step out the door did he come out and hug me for a good minute or two, saying nothing. Everything had already been said.  He is someone who can't show his feelings but has revealed them to me, so it means all the more - and that intensity of emotion is new to me. I'm not used to big shows of heartfelt romance (during our relationship) or honest declarations of love and understanding (a couple of days ago - sadly so late in the game but really appreciated), so yes, I am finding it hard to believe I will have that again. Even friends I showed his letter to said they'd never had anyone say such things to them, and I can't imagine I will either.  Thank you for helping me see that not everything I feel is ""abnormal"" or to do with attachment, and you're right - I am simply heartbroken for the end of a relationship that meant something to me. I also think, looking at my relationship patterns, that I have a habit of trying to ""save"" and nurture the men I fall in love with, and that this time the man actually needed saving. So it made me feel more valued than I have before. More needed, even if I've only just had him confirm to me that he did in fact need me. But the obsessive and panicked behaviour makes me think I have some attachment anxiety issues, at least around this one man, and hopefully I can unpick and understand what was going on here.  Thanks again for listening, and for sharing your experiences; I can't tell you how much I appreciate it."

And 'aha', I recognise these thought processes.  Does this sound familiar to you?  People with this lifetrap display an excessive focus on meeting the needs of others at the expense of their own needs. These patients experience their self-sacrifice as voluntary They do it because they want to prevent other people from experiencing pain, to do what they believe is right, to avoid feeling guilty or selfish, or to maintain a connection with significant others whom they perceive as needy. The Self-Sacrifice schema often results from what we believe to be a highly empathic temperament – an acute sensitivity to the pain of others. Some people feel the psychic pain of others so intensely that they are highly motivated to alleviate or prevent it. They do not want to do things or allow things to happen that will cause other people pain. Self-Sacrifice often involves a sense of over-responsibility for others. It thus overlaps with the concept of codependence.  It is common for patients with this schema to have psychosomatic symptoms such as headaches, gastrointestinal problems, chronic pain, or fatigue. Physical symptoms may provide these patients with a way to bring attention to themselves, without having to ask for it directly and without conscious awareness. They feel permission to receive are or to decrease their care for others if they are “really sick”. These symptoms may also be a direct result of the stress created by giving so much and receiving so little in return.  People with this schema almost always have an accompanying Emotional Deprivation schema. They are meeting the needs of others; but their own needs are not getting met. On the surface, they appear content to self-sacrifice, but underneath, they feel a deep sense of emotional deprivation. Sometimes they feel angry at the objects of their sacrifice. Usually patients with this schema are giving so much that they end up hurting themselves.  Often, these people believe that they do not expect anything back from others, but when something happens and the other person does not give as much back, they feel resentful. Anger is not inevitable with this schema, but people who self-sacrifice to a significant degree, and have people around them who are not reciprocating, usually experience at he least some resentment.  it is important to distinguish self-sacrifice form subjugation. When people have the Subjugation schema, they surrender their own needs out of fear of external consequences. They are afraid that other people are going to retaliate or reject them. With the Self-Sacrifice schema, people surrender their own needs out of an inner sense or standard. Subjugated people experience themselves as being under the control of other people; self-sacrificing patients experience themselves as making voluntary choices.  The origins of these two schemas are different as well. Although the two overlap, they are almost opposite in their origins. The origin of Subjugation is usually a domineering and controlling parent; with the Self-Sacrifice, the parent is typically weak, needy, a childlike, helpless, ill, or depressed. Thus, the former develops from interaction with a parent who is too strong, and the latter with a parent who is too weak or ill.  People with the Self-Sacrifice schema typically exhibit behaviors such as listening to others rather than talking about themselves; taking care of other people, yet having difficulty doing things for themselves; focusing attention on other people, yet feeling uncomfortable when attention is focus on them, and being indirect when they want something, rather than asking directly.  There can also be secondary gain with this schema. The schema has positive aspects and is only pathological when brought to an unhealthy extreme. Patients might feel a sense of pride in seeing themselves as caretakers. They might feel that they are good for behaving altruistically, that they are behaving in a morally virtuous way. (In contrast, sometimes the schema has a “never enough” quality, so that no matter how much self-sacrifices do, they still feel guilty that it is not enough.) Another potential source of secondary gain is that the schema might draw other people to them. Many people enjoy the empathy and help of the self-sacrifice. People with this schema usually have many friendships, although their own needs often are not being met in these relationships.  In terms of over compensatory behaviors, after self-sacrificing for a long time, some patients suddenly flip into excessive anger. They become enraged and cut off giving to the other person completely. When self-sacrificers feel unappreciated, they sometimes retaliate by conveying to the other person: “I’m not going to give you anything ever again. Click to expand...  The self-sacrifice schema, as it's called, is a pattern of thinking that is almost always a coping mechanism for another pattern of thinking called emotional deprivation. I was completely unable to see myself in the description of emotional deprivation when I first started therapy and have only been able to see myself in it in the last couple of months - a year after therapy. One of the main tenets of emotional deprivation is that the patient can't feel it or doesn't notice it. This is largely because they do not know they have needs to be fulfilled, as their needs were ignored as a child. That's what I meant about the message ""I don't matter"" being given by caregivers that did not meet my emotional needs, but I thought all of that was normal so to me there was no problem. Here's the description of emotional deprivation anyway:  This is probably the most common schema we treat in our work, although patients frequently do not recognize that they have it. Patients with this schema often enter treatment feeling lonely, bitter, and depressed, but usually not knowing why; or they present with vague or unclear symptoms that later prove to be related to the Emotional Deprivation schema. These patients do not expect other people-including the therapist-to nurture, understand, or protect them. They feel emotionally deprived, and may feel that they do not get enough affection and warmth, attention, or deep emotions expressed. They may feel that no one is there who can give them strength and guidance. Such patients may feel misunderstood and alone in the world. They may feel cheated of love, invisible, or empty.  As we have noted, there are three types of deprivation: deprivation of nurturance, in which patients feel that no one is there to hold them, pay attention to them, and give them physical affection, such as touch and holding; deprivation of empathy, in which they feel that no one is there who really listens or tries to understand who they are and how they feel; and deprivation of protection, in which they feel that no one is there to protect and guide them (even though they are often giving others a lot of protection and guidance). The Emotional Deprivation schema is often linked to the Self-Sacrifice schema. Most patients with a Self-Sacrifice schema are also emotionally deprived.  Typical behaviours exhibited by these patients include not asking significant others for what they need emotionally; not expressing a desire for love or comfort; focusing on asking the other person questions but saying little about oneself; acting stronger than one feels underneath; and in other ways reinforcing the deprivation by acting as though they do not have emotional needs. Because these patients do not expect emotional support, they do not ask for it; consequently, usually they do not get it.  Another tendency we see in patients with an Emotional Deprivation schema is choosing significant others who cannot or do not want to give emotionally. They often choose people who are cold, aloof, self-centred, or needy, and therefore likely to deprive them emotionally. Other, more avoidant patients become loners. They avoid intimate relationships because they do not expect to get anything from them anyway. Either they stay in very distant relationships or avoid relationships entirely.  Patients who overcompensate for emotional deprivation tend to be overly demanding and become angry when their needs are not met. These patients are sometimes narcissistic. Because they were both indulged and deprived as children, they have developed strong feelings of entitlement to get their needs met. They believe they must be adamant in their demands to get anything at all. A minority of patients with the Emotional Deprivation schema were indulged in other ways as children. They were spoiled materially, not required to follow normal rules of behaviour, or adored for some talent or gift, but they were not given genuine love.  Another tendency in a small percentage of patients with this schema is to be overly needy. Some patients express so many needs so intensely that they come across as clinging or helpless, even histrionic. They may have many physical complaints-psychosomatic symptoms-with the secondary gain of getting people to pay attention to them and take care of them (although this function is almost always outside their awareness).  Goals of Treatment  One major goal of treatment is to help patients become aware of their emotional needs. It may feel so natural to them to have their emotional needs go unmet that they are not even aware that something is wrong. Another goal is to help patients accept that their emotional needs are natural and right. Every child needs nurturance, empathy, and protection, and, as adults, we still need these things. If patients can learn how to choose appropriate people and then ask for what they need in appropriate ways, then other people will give to them emotionally. It is not that other people are inherently depriving, it is that these patients have learned behaviours that either lead them to choose people who cannot give, or discourage people who can give from meeting their needs.  Strategies Emphasized in Treatment  There is a strong emphasis on exploring the childhood origins of this schema. The therapist uses experiential work to help patients recognize that their emotional needs were not met in childhood. Many patients never realized they were missing something, even though they had symptoms of missing something. Through imagery work, patients get in touch with the Lonely Child part of themselves and connect this mode to their presenting problems. In imagery, they express their anger and pain to the depriving parent. They list all their unmet emotional needs in childhood, and what they wish the parent had done to meet each one. The therapist enters images of childhood as the Healthy Adult, who comforts and helps the Lonely Child, and then the patient enters the image as the Healthy Adult, and comforts and helps the Lonely Child. Patients write a letter to the parent, for homework (which they do not send), about the deprivation uncovered through imagery work.  As with most of the schemas in the Disconnection and Rejection domain, the therapy relationship is central to the treatment of the schema. (The exception is the Social Isolation schema, which usually involves less emphasis on the patient-therapist relationship and more on the patient’s outside relationships.) The therapy relationship is often the first place these patients have ever allowed anyone to take care of, understand, and guide them. Through “limited reparenting,” the therapist provides a partial antidote to their emotional deprivation: a warm, empathic, and protective environment, where they can get many of their emotional needs met. If the therapist cares about and reparents the patient, then this will ease the patient’s sense of deprivation. As with the Abandonment schema, the therapy relationship provides a model that patients can then transfer to others in their lives outside therapy (a “corrective emotional experience” (Alexander, 1956). Like the Abandonment schema, there is a great deal of emphasis on the patient’s intimate relationships. The therapist and patient carefully study the patient’s relationships with significant others. Patients work on choosing appropriate partners and close friends, identifying their own needs, and asking to have these needs met in appropriate ways.  Cognitively, the therapist helps patients change their exaggerated sense that significant others are acting selfishly or depriving them. To counter the “black or white” thinking that fuels overreactions, the patient learns to discriminate gradations of deprivation to see a continuum rather than just two opposing poles. Even though other people set limits on what they give, they still care about the patient. Patients identify the unmet emotional needs in their current relationships.  Behaviourally, patients learn to choose nurturing partners and friends.  They ask their partners to meet their emotional needs in appropriate ways and accept nurturance from significant others. Patients stop avoiding intimacy. They stop responding with excessive anger to mild levels of deprivation and withdrawing or isolating when they feel neglected by others.  In the therapy relationship, the therapist provides a nurturing atmosphere with attention, empathy, and guidance, making special attempts to demonstrate emotional involvement (e.g., remembering the patient’s birthday with a card). The therapist helps the patient express feelings of deprivation without overreacting or remaining silent. The patient learns to accept the therapist’s limitations and to tolerate some deprivation, while appreciating the nurturing the therapist does provide. The therapist helps the patient connect feelings in the therapy relationship with early memories of deprivation, and to work on these experientially.  Special Problems with This Schema  The most common problem is that patients with this schema are so frequently unaware of it. Even though Emotional Deprivation is one of the three most common schemas we work with (Subjugation and Defectiveness schemas are the others), people often do not know that they have it. Because they never got their emotional needs met, patients often do not even realize that they have unmet emotional needs. Thus, helping patients make a connection between their depression, loneliness, or physical symptoms on the one hand, and the absence of nurturing, empathy, and protection on the other is very important. We have found that asking patients to read the Emotional Deprivation chapter of Reinventing Your Life (Young &: Klosko, 1993) can often help them recognize the schema. They can identify with some of the characters or recognize the behaviour of a depriving parent.  Patients with this schema often negate the validity of their emotional needs. They deny that their needs are important or worthwhile, or they believe that strong people do not have needs. They consider it bad or weak to ask others to meet their needs and have trouble accepting that there is a Lonely Child inside them who wants love and connection, both from the therapist and from significant others in the outside world.  Similarly, patients may believe that significant others should know what they need, and that they should not have to ask. All of these beliefs work against the patient’s ability to ask others to meet his or her needs. These patients need to learn that it is human to have needs, and healthy to ask others to meet them. It is human nature to be emotionally vulnerable. What we aim for in life is a balance between strength and vulnerability, so that sometimes we are strong and other times we are vulnerable. To only have one side-to only be strong-is to be not fully human and to deny a core part of ourselves. Click to expand...  The key thing here is that your focus on the needs of others is actually covering up a well of need in yourself. You might not be consciously aware of it, and you may feel that you are simply 'stronger' and able to bear the burden for others when they are needy and upset, and you may feel this is simply the 'right' thing to do. But the obsessiveness you're now feeling is your brain going into fight or flight and saying to you 'I NEED this!' and what you need is to feel like you matter - like you belong, like you have a place in the world, like you are a person of value and worth. That's why that letter and that long hug mean so much to you, because they are little scraps of love to show you are significant in some way, to some one, somewhere.  I can totally empathise with that. But although it sounds like they were beautiful things he did for you, believe me when I say these are scraps, and you don't need to beg for scraps because consistent love exists all around you for you to accept when it is offered. I don't mean to say he is a bad person, he is just in need, as you say, but for that reason he was not able to give you that heartfelt declaration of love earlier in the relationship, or to respond to your needs in a healthy way. That's unfortunate for both of you, but when your brain goes into overdrive and you start obsessing about him, just tell it - love exists everywhere and I matter to a lot of people and I will be significant and special to many, many others, and I will always be significant and special to me.  If you can relate to 'why' you are feeling that way it won't be quite as scary."

You sound similar to me in a lot of ways so it's a bit like going back in time to save younger me, quite selfishly  All this stuff is stuff I learned in therapy and I found it really helpful. You might want to try the book reinventing your life, which is a schema therapy workbook that gives you tips and exercises to overcome emotional deprivation and self sacrifice. There might be others in there too you recognise - with me, I have a very high unrelenting standards schema, which is to say 'pathological perfectionism', which feeds into the other two and makes matters worse.  Also you are the first person I've spoken to who has related to feelings of shame over feeling needy. I strongly value independence and hate needing others, but in recent years I have swung towards the 'histrionic' style of emotional deprivation, where I have so many needs that I am totally needy all the time, and I'm struggling to deal with that seeing as I believe I should be strong and independent. In reality, it's probably a phase I need to go through in order to balance myself out. I had a lot of needs for a really long time and I didn't even know they were there. Completely destroyed me for a while, but don't worry, as I say, I think I was quite a lot more extreme than you. You seem to have a wider view of being able to see that there is a problem - i.e. that your feeling like this about your ex is hurting you. Prior to therapy, I was so convinced that I would not meet another person for whom I would experience the same intense feelings that I did not think there was anything unusual about my obsessive feelings - it was totally rational, since to me love didn't exist. But you can see a wider world view, so that's a great sign  BTW, I have traits of both self-sacrifice and subjugation as well. My mother had BPD and was fragile/emotionally manipulative with it (leading to self-sacrifice) - her love was a 'I love you because I need you to love me' kind of love; while my Dad was strongly narcissistic with an extreme avoidant attachment, so he did not hug or show warmth and only ever criticised. Additionally, my Mam would immediately reject me if I did not provide for her or if her feelings were hurt (takes things personally a lot, even if they aren't personal), so with those traits of my Mam's and the 'strong, domineering' style of my father (he would read my personal diaries and attempt to control my life), I also developed a touch of subjugation. You sound more self sacrificey though. Subjugation you can often see in people with an abandonment schema (these people sometimes literally feel that when a person walks out of the room the connection is lost). In order to avoid the pain of abandonment, subjugators will knowingly put their needs to one side to cling on. So the difference is that they will consciously and clearly say: ""I have to help him or he will leave me"". A self sacrificer will say ""I have to help him, he needs me"". Underneath 'he needs me' is a far more unconscious 'I need him', but self sacrificer's rarely have that at the front of their minds.  In my most intense relationship - the one where I felt loved (sometimes, but he actually wasn't that giving either, he gave mixed messages) - I did know I needed him and that caused me to want to emotionally distance a bit, try to put other thoughts in that place or to look at other men or just obsess about something else, because I didn't trust that relationships can last (although I'd always had long-term relationships, still didn't prove anything to me...) and I thought it was dangerous to rely on any one ('others cannot provide for me consistently', is the message). But that's the only time I've been aware of needing someone. Most of the time, I have fallen into that 'loner' category they put up there - the one who either does not enter relationships with others, or remains in very distant ones where their needs will never be met because they believe no one will meet them (that describes the four-year relationship I finally left last year).  You will probably have a less 'core' abandonment schema too, as you were 'emotionally abandoned' as they put it. So you may feel that when your ex travels the connection is 'lost', that he will forget about you altogether. He won't, but that might be how you're feeling, because your experience might be (mine is) that people's hearts are fickle and when you stop mattering, you just stop mattering. I expect others to view me with utter indifference, for example."

We had been exploring this in my general life and I had an accident in the middle of the night where I fell and cut my face badly and I sat in the dark quietly for a couple of hours waiting for the ambulance, making sure I didn't wake my flatmate. The fact that my flatmate would have wanted to know and to help me had never even occurred to me. That was a massive wake up call!  I don't expect love or nurturing or protection from anyone else. In my journals I've written ""but what about ME?"" in my lowest moments.  I so relate to being wary of relying on anyone. After my best long term relationship ended - despite me ending it (I felt I was the only one investing in our future: within two years of the break up he was married) - I had to rebuild my whole life from scratch. I'd planned so much around this guy. I had, essentially, needed him, and look what a mess I ended up in! I swore never again to plan my life around someone else.  Looking back I can see that my past relationships were all a game of who needs who. My long term relationships were full of me acting like the nurturer but I ultimately ended them because I didn't feel needed enough. I suppose because I equate attention with love and being needed as being valued, if I didn't have that reassurance I fled - but I obviously refused to accept these things were needs. I just felt embarassed that I needed more from somebody else in the first place.  I've cancelled second dates because I felt the guy, while clearly interested, wasn't eager enough. At the same time I've pushed and pushed guys who showed hesitation or were distant, until I find myself behaving in a needy way and then flee out of mortification. Either way, I get the same results.  Although I stay friends with every single ex boyfriend or ex fling - not sure what that says about me except that I can't let go. Perhaps it's the reassurance of them liking me even just as a friend that I cling to? That little scrap?  It is so true that I hang onto scraps of love, as if they are enough. ""But LOOK at this bit of love he showed you!"" my mind tells me, ""And it means so much more coming from him because he can't ever show love!"" I can see now how that actually isn't enough."

Since december 2019 ive had a few on and off sore throats. They were there for a week or two, went away and came back 1 week later. This went on until June 2021. In April 2021 i also went through a covid infection. In this time i went to my doctor Several times. He thought of different things like: hyperventilation, GERD and viral phyrangitis. Since June 2021 ive had a persistent sore throat with no day without pain. In May 2021 i did a blood test which said i had undergone an EPV infection Anywhere in my life and i also went to the ENT Doctor. He diagnosed me with viral phyrangitis.  Everyday i experience a very tight pain in my throat since June 2021. I also feel quite short on breath everyday with headaches and painful wounds in my mouth even though i eat healthy and sleep enough.  This year ive also been diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder but im not in therapy anymore. I Just have severe anxiety about my throat being cancer because its been there for so long and doesnt go away. When i google symptoms it also matches. What do you guys think? Ever had something similar?"

My dentist first noticed I had a sore throat about six months before covid started, even though I didn't have a cold or any other symptoms at the time.  I haven't had any proper checks yet but I've been told it could be GERD - and I do have heartburn when I drink tea or eat onions etc - or a deviated septum, which can cause mucus to run down your throat, especially at night or when eating hot food. It could even be open mouth breathing, which people with anxiety are more likely to have than general members of the public. You're meant to breath through your nose and diaphragm.  What seems to help my sore throat - in the short term - is not eating any food that causes it irritation, such as the above mentioned food, as well as tomatoes and spicy sauces etc. It basically means eating a bland diet for a few weeks."

Hi wheatCrunchies  Wow that is a lot to take in.... I'm wondering why did you create her in the first place? What space is she filling in your life? I'm also curious as to how she might get you into trouble? Is this because you will have to admit to your doctor that she isn't real??  Sorry for all the questions... It's very obvious that you are pretty distressed about the situation and very worried. I'm sorry that things are sort of starting to crumble for you....  Do you think there is a healthier way you could fill the gap if you were to essentially say goodbye to your sister.. Maybe by telling the doctor about her might be a first step towards changing things...  I'm worried that you have named her as your next of kin..... I think that puts a more urgent slant in having to come clean..  I imagine that you will feel a bit lost without her so maybe you could hold on to the image of her for really bad times.... Like 'cutting back' on your time with her...  Lots of children have imaginary friends that help them and it's perfectly normal so don't give yourself a hard time over it... She may have helped you alot when you had no one else..  Best wishes Shadow

Those wasn't the only reasons I created her there are many and sometimes I do and say things and I don't even know why I do it. I guess another reason was also for comfort. She talks to me in my head shes like the main voice in my head but shes a good one.  Well the reason now why I could be in a lot of trouble was because I got really drunk last week and I popped some pills so I was really out of it, and I sent my support worker an e-mail that I slept with my sister which I didn't it was just a fantasy of mine and I acted out of character, and also she she don't exist but my support worker don't know that and now other organizations are involved and possibly the police.

Legally NOK doesnt actually mean anything, its just who you have named that you want then to call in an emergency. You don't have to even give a reason for changing it.  Nearest relative is different, thats a legal term under the mental health act, so if you have named her as this then its more complex. I think it only comes into play if you are really poorly e.g. arround issues with sectioning and CTOs or emergency assessments. But it could make things tricky if they thought that you had a sister. I think in the abscence of family you would get a MH advocate to act in this role. Someone from an organisation seperate from the NHS.  You would only be sectioned if they felt that you were a risk to yourself or others and they didn't feel they could manage the risk in the community. You would be offered voluntry admission to hospital first. Sectioning is a last resort, you have to be really very poorly. I really don't think admitting that your sister is imaginary on its own would get you sectioned. My husband has had some very odd beliefs and been treated at home, for example, he thought I was an undercover police officer monitoring him, he thought I was trying to poison him, he though the priminister was intercepting his phonecalls he wasn't sectioned if that makes you feel any better."

About 5 weeks ago, when driving back from Birmingham to London on the M40 (after a fairly tiring party weekend, though was sober) I suffered a sudden nervousness... this escalated into a feeling of dread and the fact my arms stiffened and I was scared to even switch lanes. Somehow managed to get myself to the nearest Service Station. Heart was racing. Had to call a friend to rescue me and drive me home the remaining 80 miles. I was in this fear mode for probably 3 hours...  This past Saturday, I encountered a motorway for the first time since then, with my wife and kids in the car. Felt totally fine beforehand and navigated the 60 mile trip fine on the way. On the way back however I suddenly felt similar (albeit not as extreme) feelings as the earlier attack so had to pull over and let my wife drive.  I have a trip this coming weekend requiring a long motorway drive (alone), so yesterday I tried driving one junction on the M4 (which is very busy and restricted to 50mph), I was fine. Today I tried a junction on the M25 with my wife next to me... the fear and stiffened arms came to me again. I did manage to navigate it but definitely felt highly uncomfortable and had to slow down in the slow lane and was so relieved to come off. Heart rate rose again.

About 5 weeks ago, when driving back from Birmingham to London on the M40 (after a fairly tiring party weekend, though was sober) I suffered a sudden nervousness... this escalated into a feeling of dread and the fact my arms stiffened and I was scared to even switch lanes. Somehow managed to get myself to the nearest Service Station. Heart was racing. Had to call a friend to rescue me and drive me home the remaining 80 miles. I was in this fear mode for probably 3 hours...  This past Saturday, I encountered a motorway for the first time since then, with my wife and kids in the car. Felt totally fine beforehand and navigated the 60 mile trip fine on the way. On the way back however I suddenly felt similar (albeit not as extreme) feelings as the earlier attack so had to pull over and let my wife drive.  I have a trip this coming weekend requiring a long motorway drive (alone), so yesterday I tried driving one junction on the M4 (which is very busy and restricted to 50mph), I was fine. Today I tried a junction on the M25 with my wife next to me... the fear and stiffened arms came to me again. I did manage to navigate it but definitely felt highly uncomfortable and had to slow down in the slow lane and was so relieved to come off. Heart rate rose again.

I would continue to see the counselor. Questions What do you think is causing this anxiety for you? How is your work life? Are you stressed out, at work? Did you suffer a major life event, other then Covid-19? There is always a factor or factors that causes anxiety, and it is best to find that out. You find the cause or causes, then you work on the cause or causes, then your anxiety should go down. Medications are ok, but they come with side-effects, and they do not get to the root cause of your issues. If for example, if you fly, then finding out, why your afraid of flying. And a side note: Sometimes it is helpful to avoid doing the things, that caused your anxiety in the first place. I wish nothing but the best, in getting the help you need for your anxiety. Please keep us updated on how your doing."

I lost my mother three years back due to cancer. I was just trying to cope with the situation but in the next year I got to know that my younger brother has end stage renal disease. In the meantime, I also got married hurriedly (with the wish to have my mom present at the wedding but that eventually didn't happen). My husband and I work in London and my brother stays in India, our native country. Now I am always in the constant mental pressure that I am not there with my brother in this time. He has to go through a kidney transplant but we cannot start the process as I am away. Due to covid, all my plans this year got cancelled. I am juggling so much between my job, my married life and the situation with my brother. Recently, I got diagnosed with some hormonal conditions and have been advised to conceive as soon as possible. I want that too. But I do not know how I can handle a pregnancy and also my brother's health, with my husband staying away from me. I am so anxious that cannot sleep, often quarrel with my husband or even my brother himself!! I know it is harmful for my health. Please help!  Sorry for the long first message but I hope you understand my situation. Hope to receive some answers.  Thanking you, MimiSubs"

Long story short I’ve suffered with health anxiety for years, since I was 9 years old, and I’ve always excessively worried about everything. I’ve recently started counselling to get my anxiety under control and it hasn’t seemed to help so far which stresses me out a lot even though I know I need to accept that these things take time. I’ve also recently been diagnosed with disordered breathing pattern, which as a health anxiety sufferer, of course I thought the symptoms were due to every terrible illness under the sun including lung cancer etc.  Anyway, I’m still finding it extremely hard to accept that this is disordered breathing... I constantly think I’ve been misdiagnosed and that the doctors have missed something despite having tests and them giving me the all clear multiple times. I’m just terrified. I constantly feel like I can’t breathe properly, I need more oxygen, I feel so air hungry, I’m unable to take a deep satisfying breathe, my throat feels tight and clogged (if that makes sense??) ..... as a result this has caused a number of panic attacks which once again, due to health anxiety I can’t accept that they are ‘just’ panic attacks, and it sends me into a frenzy as I think I’m dying.  Please can someone help me with this, if anyone has gone through this or something similar? It feels like a never ending tunnel that I’m trapped in! I’m only young and it’s ruining my life, I’m living in fear of dying from a horrible illness that I have been told a number of times I don’t have. I’m also going on an 11 hour flight in 3 days and I’m absolutely terrified, my home has become my safe place throughout all of this recently and I’m so scared that my breathing will flare up on the plane and I have no way of getting medical attention that I feel I constantly need.

I don't have tips to offer but as I was reading this I thought about acupuncture and/or hypnosis as possible helping strategies. But I don't know if you can get those with only 3 days to go till you fly. The acupuncture might be able to give you suggestions on what you can do to alleviate the worst of the symptoms whilst you are flying.  Where are you going? Anywhere nice? Just interested. Panic is a horrible problem to have and it takes a long time for therapy to help it as you tend to go round in circles initially until you manage to probe into the deeper causes. I do sympathise though.

I constantly feel like I can’t breathe properly, I need more oxygen, I feel so air hungry, I’m unable to take a deep satisfying breathe, my throat feels tight and clogged (if that makes sense??) ..... as a result this has caused a number of panic attacks which once again, due to health anxiety I can’t accept that they are ‘just’ panic attacks, and it sends me into a frenzy as I think I’m dying.  Please can someone help me with this, if anyone has gone through this or something similar? It feels like a never ending tunnel that I’m trapped in! I’m only young and it’s ruining my life, I’m living in fear of dying from a horrible illness that I have been told a number of times I don’t have. I’m also going on an 11 hour flight in 3 days and I’m absolutely terrified, my home has become my safe place throughout all of this recently and I’m so scared that my breathing will flare up on the plane and I have no way of getting medical attention that I feel I constantly need.  Sorry this is so long! But I’m really struggling and if there’s someone who has suffered/knows someone who has suffered please let me know!  P.S If anyone has any tips/ coping strategies for the plane please let me know because I’m so scared. Click to expand... I can totally relate to how you are feeling, I am going through this at the moment. And I feel so miserable, I have had test after test and got the all clear on everything. But I am also feeling like I don’t inhale enough or I don’t let enough air out, then I get a knot In my stomach like I’m ive missed a breath and I’m focusing on this constantly. I don’t know what has started it. I think maybe my anxiety meds maybe have come to an end with me and have stopped working. I will be ringing doctors in the morning to see about increasing my dose or changing the tablets all together. It’s a shame because they made me feel somewhat normal for a long time and now all this. One doctor told me to breath in and count to 5 then exhale slowly counting to 7 it worked for me the first time but I think I’ve got so worked up I can’t concentrate on the counting and relaxing. Here if you need to talk, I’m sure there is nothing wrong and it’s our anxiety messing with us."

I’ve suffered with anxiety since I was a kid. Sometimes I’ve had long periods where things were more or less under control, then everything goes crazy again. I worry literally about everything, whether it’s worth worrying about or not. In about 10 seconds, I can escalate a tiny incident to nuclear level. I need to feel in control, and life’s not always like that. Herbal remedies have helped a bit, talking therapy was hopeless - I know exactly what I’m like and why, I just can’t stop it! I would like to hear about other people’s experiences. My family are sympathetic, but they don’t know what I’m feeling, and I’m afraid sometimes to tell them, as it makes me sound as if I’m completely crazy - try explaining to a normal person why you feel a desperate need to photograph all the light switches before you go on vacation, so you know you’ve switched them off! It would be good to know that there are others out there with similar experiences."

We were going out for dinner once, and I was genuinely looking forward to it. So we get to the train station, and I realise that I’ve got odd shoes on - I have two pairs that are very similar, and I’d got on one of each. Nobody would have noticed, but that’s the trigger, and I start to get anxious. Then there’s a problem with the trains, they’re delayed, and the anxiety starts to ramp up. Eventually we get to the restaurant, and the dish that I really wanted to have is off the menu - I’ll have to choose something else. And I’m gone. I’ve got all that adrenaline slopping around and nowhere for it to go. Full blown panic attack, and we have to leave. And as soon as I’m out of the door, and I know that nothing’s expected of me, I calm down again. I feel like a total freak. Food is important in my family, everyone else loves going to fancy restaurants, and I’m absolutely terrified. Rationally, I know that most people are too self-absorbed to care what I’m doing, or eating, but there’s the fear that they’re watching me and expecting me to perform, and I won’t come up to their expectations.

I've previously had depression and anxiety issues and overcome them through CBT and once with Citalopram also. I'm currently awaiting a referral for more CBT due to anxiety issues, but I've been relatively fine waiting for my assessment date.  However at the beginning of the week I began to have flu like symptoms. I have fatigue, general muscle soreness, constant headache and loss of appetite. Weirdly I have also been feeling increasingly homesick, to the point where I cried on and off all day Monday and some of Tuesday. I've also struggled to sleep from not feeling well but then I've been unable to shut my mind off which has kept me buzzing and even more awake. I've lived for five years in London (originally from Glasgow) and I've been fine really, even during my time being treated for my depression and anxiety. But I just keep thinking about home and my parents. My sister is moving abroad for a while next month so I've decided to book tickets home before she goes away.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has similar feelings? Do you think it's my flu making me want to be at home because it's a comfort thing? Do you think it will fade once I feel better or should I go to my GP and see if they could prescribe something to help me relax or to sleep? I don't feel like I could make a visit there as I feel so ill but is it worth me ringing them or the NHS info line?  Thank you so much for your advice. I just feel so down currently and wish I didn't feel like this."

I imagine having the flu is making you homesick as you are remembering when you were unwell and lived at home and were looked after. I think with flu it takes two weeks to go. It could be worth calling the GP but usually with flu all you can do is rest. I really hope you get better soon.

She is quite germaphobe and worries about small plastic particles in food. Obviously the Corona crisis has made things worse. She is obsessed with cleanliness, while I am not. We did some couple therapy some years back, on a variety of issues.  We argue quite often about cleaning etc. She blames me a lot for not complying with her cleaning/hygiene rules. I feel quite restricted by her ‘regime’. But obviously I don’t want to upset her, I follow the ‘rules’ many times but I do have my limits and maybe enabling her regime is not the right way.  Some of the worries I can brush off by reassuring her that all is fine. But there is just a constant flow of them. I find managing this quite exhausting as well.  When I call her condition germaphobia, she gets offended.  She can get quite angry as well and she says I am making her into a ‘witch’. I am torn between giving in and also calling what it is - it’s not normal.  I feel her phobia is also misplaced - not the real reason for her stress. Maybe it’s a way for her to fend off a full depression.  Apart from couple therapy, do you have any suggestions - communication style or books?"

OK so for just over a month I've been doing really well anxiety wise my depression is still there but I'd rather have depression than the anxiety!! Anyway like I said anxiety fine. Well today is my bday (please don't worry about saying anything) I've felt fine all morning woke up at 7am. So I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth and bam out of nowhere I went panicky got all sweaty sicky feeling like I was about to have an anxiety attack! I've sat down and nothing else happened. I'm so confused. I feel fine now but I'm soooo scared its going to happen again and I know that's not the right way to think!!

Happy Birthday - birthdays should be celebrated as a sign of survival. 2. Constantly. It is actually why I am online right now. I woke up and my head is spinning and I feel emotionally shaky. I just found the forum today so while I'm real sorry you are feeling this way in a way it is reassuring to know I am not the only person this happens to. I'm sorry if that sounds weird or mean or I don't know what. I just found this site so I'm hoping that it helps my perspective on what happens to me. So I guess what I'm trying to say is - you have shown me that I'm not alone in feeling these things and I can tell you you are not alone in feeling these things.

I've never really celebrated my birthday so I don't ever get excited anymore but that is a really good way to think!!. An no that sounds fine! It's nice to know we're not alone. It's so annoying cause I've felt fine for ages and I've been really lucky to have felt great but when I had that feeling back again I just thought oh no! And made me feel so bad cause I hate having anxiety! (I know everyone hates it and I also know some people have it alot worse than me) but when I get it I literally cannot do anything and I just cry all the time.. I feel OK now. (touch wood) I think it's my own fault. I completely cut caffeine out my life since having anxiety and this morning I felt great and thought ah it's my bday ill treat myself to a cuppa tea. I think thats what's done it major caffeine hit and made me go all dizzy then I panicked..

I just need someone to explain to me that this is normal so the monkey on my back can stop freaking out about it. For context, I'm 25, and over the last few years I have had many, many ECG's, an ultrasound of my heart, a chest X-ray and multiple cardiac blood tests all of which are clean.

Motivation requires something at the end of an unpleasent task which is quite pleasurable. For me its video games. Ill do stuff i dont like to get to what i do like. What do you enjoy most? Can you use it to motivate you to do things you dont want to?.  You can artificially do this by remaining hungry. Refuse to eat until its done. The body always loves food.

You need to try to eat and drink well and that might help with sleeping and working. There are plenty of websites on eating a balanced diet. I know its hard but I think you're possibly making things worse by relying on caffeine and sugar.  Are you under any mental health team?

Try to set up a proper desk space so you're not working in bed or sat on the settee. This can be really hard depending on your home situation.  You need to set small goals - you'll do x before a certain time, rather than just drifting through the day.  You need to have a clear work plan - what it is you're doing, who is paying you for it or how will it generate money and by when. If what you are doing will not generate income then should you be focusing on it at all?  You definitely need structure.

These websites that run poker games make millions relying on people like you who assume they can outplay a computer. Its easy money for them and they play on peoples insecurities and dreams. we all want money and to be able to do what we want everyday but that is unrealistic at best, and naive. I work in a job i hate and would love to spend my days reading and writing books but hey, I have a house, bills and responsibilities so I work in a crap job and make the most of my spare time doing what I like.

Anxiety is tricky. The more you give into it, teh bigger a hold it gets on you. That is - every time anxiety keeps you from going out - it makes it harder to go out the next time. Anxiety is greedy, it want you all to itself.  Another thing about it is that it's a glitch in your flight or fight reflex. For some of us, we get caught in the threat recognition part, we keep looking for threats, and if we can't see one, we'll make one up to justify how we feel.  It has a physical and mental factor, and they play off each other. So - you feel nervous, which gets your mind working looking for the issue... that makes teh physical symptoms stronger, which messes up your thinking, and it bounces back and forth until you're a wreck. Your mind will remember what was happening when you felt anxious, and will trigger anxiety when that thing comes up again.  With me so far?  You can fix it, but it takes time, and work. CBT helps, it's a therapy that teaches you how to desensitize yourself to your anxiety triggers. For you, for example - you need to go out no matter how bad you feel about it. Make a goal, go out, don't come back until you've accomplished the goal. And you keep doing that until you don't feel anxious handling going out and doing that thing. It's hard - believe me, I know how you feel, but it works.  I'd pick something small. A woman in my CBT group had your issue. She started by just going over to the variety store to buy gum, or candy. That's it.  Don't overdo it, though - if you pick too stressful a task, it can backfire.  But talk to somebody - I'm just a guy on the site, lol. Look into CBT, I think it would be good for you"

I did as suggested above and broke it down until it felt manageable although I needed smaller steps. To start with it was a case of simply opening my front door and standing in the doorway and that was all I could do. I used breathing exercises to help me and gradually built up the time in the doorway from 10 secs to 5 mins. Then I started to go out. It took time and patience and the progress wasn’t linear but it worked. I second seeing a doctor. Anxiety can be helped through medication and therapy.

That said, benzos are usually only prescribed for short term use, and are by no means the only option. SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone, hydroxyzine, and beta-blockers are all examples of non addictive anxiety medications. Unfortunately, they are still medications which means in terms of side effects, every individual is going to react differently.  Gabapentin's worked really well for me and has had little to no side effects, but I know others who have taken it and have had extreme double vision. Do your research and consult your doctor, they'll also be able to offer advice. Good luck!"

Have you seen your GP about this? Are you eating well, getting a bit of exercise each day?  It is possible you are low on vitamins or iron, so you could either have that checked (when we can have blood tests again) or you can try to eat a better diet. I take multivitamins and fish oils because oily fish (mackerel) is important for mental health i think. My vitamins have Vitamin D which is useful this time of year when there is less sunlight.

Therapy is generally how you achieve longer lasting results and relief without the medications, but it does take time and for many, as many for you and myself, taking an SSRI while your working on these things helps a lot."

I decided to stop taking it because I had been taking it for four years (had therapy, worked on CBT techniques...) and I felt ready. I stopped very slowly and was feeling ok, until I was down to 20% of the medication and then stopped. So for the most part I really thought I was ""cured"" or at least that I had found a way to manage my anxiety. I just have no idea if these effects I am experiencing are part of finishing a treatment or if all this work was for nothing and I have to start again!"

Its possible you are just a little anxious about coming off the medicine and that's causing it too.  There is a very biological basis and cause for anxiety and its certainly possible you will need some medication going forward, but really that's more of a doctor discussion. But as you describe the symptoms they certainly just sound like anxiety/OCD symptoms rather than withdraw symptoms."

Well today I went to my housing office and nearly went to the wrong place then realized I was at the wrong door then I went to the right door and got my house keys out to unlock the door off the housing office and they got CCTV I had totally forgot where I was at and then my housing officer ask why I tried the lock? I had no explanation to my actions this is one of the many reasons why I can't work.

Sometimes it flares up real bad for a week and then is mostly fine the next, at least in my experience. But I think you should try not to obsess over having panic attacks, because that can create a viscous cycle where you worry about getting them, and then they keep happening. Of course, that's always easier said then done. Please do reach out and get some support from a therapist or counselor. And remember to take things one day at a time instead of thinking of the past or future, otherwise it can become more overwhelming. Hang in there"

Sorry to start my first post as a request, I would far rather be offering help but I am desperate now, I can't see through this and I am so scared. I can't seem to shift this. I don't know what to do.  I don't think I can write what its all about- I am too scared to type. Its probably the sort of thing that others would either laugh at or would also add to-scare me even further, sorry to be so vague. I'll try to kae this make sense.  I caught some news in the paper which adds to a sort of catastrophy fear I've always had at the back of my mind for as long as I can remember. Now everything is feeding into it- not just what I read. The economy, the polar ice caps, I am also terrified of people around me dying. I don't think I can cope. I'm too frightened to sleep.  Its like a proper panic attack- as much as I try to ignore the thought, my body gets a reaction- I can feel my legs become weak, shakey- my hands and limbs and shaking, my spine is shaking. I feel sick, my stomach feels strange- sort of a horrible dull ache, my chest feels like its been kicked. I find it hard to swallow. The same thoughts, words, imaghes are going through my mind....I feel so trapped. I want to stop existing- I'm terrified.  I am finding it increasingly hard to see through this- even contimplating tomorrow feels so impossible its easier to think about taking my own life. Its not as if I have an especially hard day tomorrow- its just that anything feels impossible, terrifying, and to actually be forcing myself through something feels so pointless in the face of losing everyone around me, of the future, it all feels so pointless.  Sorry to go on. I've had this drop, all of a sudden, about 5 hours ago. Since then things have felt progressivly harder. I want to sleep, its 3.40am. I am too afraid to close my eyes. I feel I can keep myself stable enough to write and to fight thinking about this whilest I am awake. I worry I wouldn't be able to do that if I am asleep.  I will try to get some medical help from my GP tomorrow, but scared to death of how I will get to tomorrow. I feel so scared right now. I am hanging on and I don't know what for.

What is it exactly about tomorrow that you fear or is it more a fear of what might happen today?  Hi Quigon, thanks for your reply.  Its not so much tomorrow that I fear, as much as the fear of carrying on with this pain all the time (emotional pain, physically shaking, feeling terrified, having images running through my mind...)  Its a bit of a long story as to hat really I feel is worrying me, because it all really began happening when I was 11. I am now 28, it comes back in spurts when I am slightly weaker for whatever reason- like a change in my lifestyle, stress or similar. Then something comes along and I tip over the edge. The last straw so to speak, is normally something catestrophic predicted to happen. It must sound really daft. I have lived through so many predictions of the apocolypse, yet the next one comes along and BANG! I'm right back to square one. No form of reminding myself of the past seems to make any difference.  Its so hard to see it any other way- despite any logic running through my mind, the emotional side is what rules the sensations in my chest, legs, back, throat....and so rules how I feel and what I feel able to do/don't feel able to do, and it just feels so endless, like I cannot escape, like this is how it will be forever and theres no way out. I end up with the same ideals- the only form of control I have against this, is to destroy myself rather then wait and have myself destroyed, after watching everyone around me being destroyed first. In the past I've always just made the decision to go to A&E or call the samaritans, it waas like a rule I had and I kept to. But I had more in my life back then, right now, I feel like I have just been existing, not going anywhere, just about keeping my head above water...then this panic/depression/fear and feeling of pointlessness comes along and the idea to call someone up for help feels so pointless.  I don't want to feel like this....I don't think I can cope with this.  I was sent by my GP to a mental health psychiatric center who sent me to hospital. I have been asked to ""clock in"" with them by visiting them every day for a while. I am seeing my psychotherapist on monday. It feels like mondays never going to happen, but I want to try to hang on for then. I have been given some sleeping pills (only 2) so I can sleep as last night I managed half an hour- I kept waking up in fear.   Am trying to take things one day at a time, but it feels so hard, so endless. It feels like this is never going to end."

Hi Dolores,  thanks for all your advice, its stuff I'm activly trying now. I know to, its just so hard implementing it when everything feels scarily pointless- its like a black line under everything I do, more shatterting then groundingly scary. I am forcing myself to take one minute at a time, which I guess is some sort of improvement on friday when I literally couldn't allow myself to look further then the second I was in.  I don't have any friends I can run to. Full stop. I had friends, but never had anyone close enough- not since I was in hospital/reidential care several years back. I had an eating disorder, I gained huge amounts of weight through my anti depressant and cut all contact with everyone out of shame and its now been years. Instead I have a heavy 'relationship' with the gym, its more a regieme then a friend though, but actually I went back yesterday (saturday) and it felt like a bit of a relief- as if its the only grip on reality I have left. My normality. With my family, they are not the sort to really understand mental health full stop let alone depression and anxiety- to my family, my eating disorder was a manipulative planned reaction to get what I wanted out of some sort of greed. I was alot stronger with an eating disorder and could take them saying that to me, it wasn't true, but I felt so strong in my anorexic mindset that nothing else really mattered, least of all what they said. I don't feel anywhere near as strong with depression. It feels scary at times still to look outside, everything instead of peaceful looks like something bad waiting to happen. I guess thats the change in my mindset. I can even see the reality, and see how my mind is manipulating things now, but it makes no difference to my feelings, nor the pain and panic I feel. So talking to my family and asking for help feels an impossibility. What I can do, is go sit at my mum's house. Just sit, mime the things I'd normally do, the laughing, the smiling... it does feel empty and at times its too painful to even do that, but the fact I can do that means alot to me. I guess in a way, its just about them being ohysically around me. I think that helps a little, even though I know they can't help me.  I am also keeping a diary- I have a therapist whom I see in the week, I'm trying to hang on for that, but have found its hard to hang on for something unless its going to happen in the next 24 hours. I have my session monday (tomorrow) which feels almost believable at the moment. But I am scared of the end of the day when the session will be over because I will then have nothing else to hang on for and the next session will feel too hard to hang onto in my mind. I'm hoping to bring what I have written to my session, although it does in many ways feel scary to even put my thoughts into words and on paper. I suppose I want to have everything blocked out- as if it all never happened. I know by writing it down, for me it almost puts it all in stone, ""this is really happening"". It makes it harder for the whole thing to (in my mind) have been a bad dream. But maybe thats a good thing. Maybe I shouldn't be running away from things right now. Or I'll ust continue the rest of my life running. Just like before."

If you'd rather not that's ok.  Hi Quigon,  I can say, on here, thats fine, theres not much to say really. I've been in a low mood generally for some years now. I guess I had something happen on thursday which was the final straw of everything. I just fell into peices. I think it was all too much and that the depression became mixed with panic and then as a result of the endelssness of how it feels, everything feels pointless, when you can see clearly how endless the whole thing is, how it feels so stringly that its never going to get any easier, any better.  I live with my family close, but not close if you know what I mean. I see them, atleast once a week if not more, but the reality is, they don't understand how depression works and tend to see if (I think) as a weakness of hypersensitivity rather then as an illustration of how your past and upbrining has influenced your thinking and how you see and experience life in general. I have learnt through the years to take what I can from them and leave it at that. They are good at existing and having their own lifes. A bit like a soap is for people, they watch soaps for the background noise, the comfort, the continuity. I guess thats how they help me, just by being there and not asking too many questions.  I don't have any aspirations, not any more. I guess I never really had a ""sole aim"" to be a doctor/teacher/lawyer like most kids do, so I don't feel like I've lost anything, but I guess it would have been nice to have a semi-sort-of plan to go with! I feel a bit aimless really! But also, I find it so scary to look far ahead. I first got depressed when I was 11. I learnt then very quickly that looking more then a few months at the most, ahead was not worth the risk as it eventually scared me and I'd drop into another depression/anxiety thing. So I don't. And I guess thats where my aspirations begin and end.  I have no job, not any more. I used to. I worked my way up from a very dead end shop assistant job into head office. But after 6 months, the company announced cuts in staff. I guess I was last in, first out as I was halfway through my staff training and costing the company money, along with not being as good at my job as the more longer term members of staff. On top of that as we had rising costs (recession) I needed more hours too, there was no way I could function on the hours I was doing. I took out a loan to do so, but couldn't pay it back really as they hours and money were low. I lost my job, had a breakdown (not like now, not as bad) and have been jobless since. I am looking for voluntary work, but am told repeatedly that I need to be 16-24, or live in a certain area, or have this that or the other experience. I'm still looking and applying, but its not as easy as getting a paid job! And unless a paid job can pay enough to live off, I don't stand a chance- I went bankrupt, the idea of taking out a loan to live off whilst I worked to gain skills/experience (as I did before) are out of my reach, I am not allowed to get credit for the next 8 years as a result of the bankrupcy.  Theres not really much to add. My life feels like its in a sort of limbo. Its been that way for years now. I'm not really living, I'm existing. Guess thats partly why it feels so pointless. I do try to put more in, but the devestation of this depression comming along makes it very hard to do so. I have built up some things- the gym, some voluntary work (not enough) and the ability to get out of bed most days. I have a psychotherapist who is great and just perfect for being there. But as things go, my life is actually very empty- I worry about putting more into it as I know I build up string dependancies on things. When they go or change, I get landed in this depression/anxiety again. Everything is a double edged sword, I have to be very careful.  Does that answer all your questions?"

I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression 4 years ago. And it was so bad back then. I am extremely lucky as over the past 2 years I've been able to manage my anxiety so it doesn't affect my whole life. But the last few months I'm soooo tired. Its making me so depressed. I love going out and going for walks and not alot makes me anxious anymore. But I'm so tired my stress levels are quite high at the moment.. I feel like I've done alot to change my life and I feel worse physically!. I don't drink coffee I don't smoke I don't drink alcohol.I eat healthy I exercise regularly but I feel more exhausted now than when I was smoking and drinking and eating crap!! I've had blood tests done and everything is ok.. I gave up all these things to make my anxiety better and now I'm stuck as a lifeless shell of a person that is alway absolutely exhausted!.. I generally don't know what to do anymore..

I'd be so tired at the end of the day I would just collapse in a big, comfortable, reclining chair and let it swallow me. The next thing I knew is I had slept 3-4 hours. After that, I would feel a lot better catching the rest I needed. Anxiety is notorious for sapping a body of its strength and stamina.

I ask myself everyday why mental health in the UK is such a big issue. As a sufferer i cant help but think that a lot of my anxiety is caused by things that are out of my control and just wondered if others felt the same???? If you look at how us humans live on a global scale it really doesn't surprise me that people suffer from these horrible debilitating conditions. Look at how stressful life is, the unnecessary rules you see everywhere and everyday, the consequences you are faced with after making a small mistake, how essential money is and how hard life is without it and what you have to do to get it, the expectation to conform and the fear of not, the list goes on.  People live to work and work has been made so stressful. In an ideal work would we work all day everyday to come home for a few hours to then go to bed and repeat. Would there even be a need for currency? Would we live such rushed, selfish, materialistic, money driven lifestyles? Would we feel the need to look an act a certain way and feel the need to have certain things? If your self employed and you feel ill and can't go to work should that fear be there that your going to fall behind on bills, cant put food on the table, going to lose the house etc.  Basically i think we live in a very far from ideal world and i strongly think that the way we are forced to live definitely impacts many people negatively, in some cases that is shown through anxiety and depression....... i just ask myself why? why do we live this way? why are we making ourselves ill? why do 1percent control the other 99, why do we make our lives so bloody difficult and stressful. It literally seems like theres a few people sitting in a room somewhere having a discussion about how difficult they want to make life for other people. Like they are sitting there watching us on screens enjoying the unnecessary bullshit we all have to put up with everyday loving that the minority are rich and majority poor it just all makes no sense to me."

The main problem is the socio-economic system itself.

It's not the first time someone's blamed the way the world is run for mental illness. It's inherent in the capitalist system but it exists elsewhere too, it's just dealt with differently and therefore the recovery rate is higher. I suppose in that way you can't just blame capitalism for it all but it makes it worse. There's lots of conspiracy theories about the 1%, I wouldn't advise going there or it could make you I'll, I know it does that to me. They do control us all, though, and I suppose as that's what keeps them where they are it's understandable that they want to do that.  We can't change it on here, but a good rant always helps get it out of your system. I agree with you wholeheartedly but that's the way it is. I suspect it's not about to change and we just have to put up with the idiots that don't question the status quo and happily lap up modern society's values and beliefs. Take comfort in the fact that you are not that blind and gullible and my advice would be to forget about it because there's nothing we can do for them. Once you're labelled mad nobody listens to you. But you have more insight than most people and I sympathise with you, you are not alone in your beliefs and many more than me and you feel this way."

When i say its human nature, that doesn't justify what is taking place. Its not impossible to change the world but it is impossible when there are certain individuals still breathing. When people have a certain mentality and then they are having kids and brainwashing them and this process keeps taking place, obviously things will not change unless people stand up and speak out which not many are willing to do because of the consequences. Through history look at what happens to people who oppose the governments. Fear is what keeps these people in power, fear is why things remain how they are. If you sat down and deeply explained these things to a number of people you would be surprised at how many agree with how we think, BUT fear is what stops them speaking out and taking action. Its a shame that as a species we have aloud it to get to this point really. The world is brainwashed the world is selfish and the world is scared. Even religions will not go against governments, religious people strongly share these views but do you not see that its the religions changing with time and not the governments? why is that? an example is gay marriage being made legal, marriage was created by religion not governments yet governments say it is now ok for gay marriage? Then certain christian cells say that gay marriage is now acceptable, why is this? FEAR. Nelson Mandela spent how many years in prison fighting for equality? The south african government at the time feared him but why do you think we don't see modern day mandelas? FEAR. Its a brainwashed, selfish, greedy, self absorbed, materialistic, narrow minded money driven world we live in my friend. p.s. im not homophobic the gay marriage thing is just an example of how even religions the one thing that makes sense of this world to me, even they are corrupt, brainwashed and fearful."

Fair enough with some of the long articles & i don't read all of them either, unless it starts a discussion.  My view's are imo in essence very simple. Mainly that -  A lot of the way things are in this society/culture/civilisation is systemic (At the level of the socioeconomic & other systems).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory  The way people are treated largely effects their well being - treat people badly they feel worse - treat people well they feel better.  & my main pet theory on mental health, & what i feel is a far more healthy model is integral/holistic, that biology, psychology, sociology [A model already used at least in theory by orthodox psychiatry] (& the spiritual/transpersonal, who some within psychiatry also add) is integrated/interdependent, & that we need to take a whole person view/understanding & approach to all these areas.  That's basically it. i don't mind you disagreeing, but do people even know what it is they're disagreeing with? & what about it all don't you understand? Even just as a model/theory.  Fair enough if people want to disagree, it's more it seems however i try & explain it all it's that people can't fathom it, when to me it seems self explanatory/obvious. i find it a bit frightening that so many people can't fathom what i'm on about. It's Not just on here either, most people in my life don't know what i'm talking about either. To a few it's obvious, but to many i may as well be speaking an Alien language. Sorry, but i don't get what's difficult to understand from the pov of the idea of a basic integral model? Leave aside all the debate, commentary, different models & agreeing/disagreeing around it all, what don't you get about a basic integral view?"

But with 'functional' mental health conditions & people of 'average' intelligence i don't really see what the issue is, or what is so hard to understand? i don't really think it is a question of innate intelligence, i think it has far more to do with the systematic dumbing down of society/the population, & all the endless lies, brainwashing, distractions, denials, drama, manipulation & other bullshit that we're constantly fed in this society.  Unless of course i am just some mad person rambling incoherent & unintelligible nonsense."

None of my family are religious, but im a deep thinker and like i said in an earlier post of the two possibilities/theories science and religion, to me us being the product of creation with a purpose makes more sense than us being here by chance and evolving from monkeys :/.  Many believe that the suffering that takes place is literally because god is not in control at the moment, satan is. We have been left to do as we want and there is a satanic influence, god has not intervened because he is proving how much we need him.

Neither did i say that we have no control. I said they were the beliefs of some religious people. I also said maybe your right, i most definitely did not say that i agree with you because they are not my beliefs. I believe we have a choice i also believe that we are influenced by evil which is evident in the world. I think that some people allow evil to take over but all should and can fight against it. If you look back at what ive wrote you'll see that you are not mocking my beliefs because they are not my beliefs. Every person that believes in god does not share the same beliefs. I think that suffering to a certain extent is predestined the christian bible and story of the garden of eden is an example of that but we our making it worse through choice because we all have free will. There is a big difference between control and influence.  people who make excuses for doing bad things because they say its the devil and we have no control and we are born with sin need to re-think because that is not the case. Religion is complex thats why people have gone to war and died and killed over the years. Im open minded and take bits from all religions. I have a belief in god and certain things that i believe and thats all. We can all have opinions but at the end of the day its always arguable if its fact. But life without god to me seems pointless as science doesnt offer anything other than the limited time we have on earth right now."

I'm sorry if I picked you up wrong. I believe there is a choice someone made somewhere that leads to future suffering. For example, the bullies that made my life hell and (according to the mental health system) caused me to develop OCD had a choice not to bully me. The Tory party has the choice whether or not to cut welfare and enforce austerity. That suffering is not out of their control. Maybe there are forces influencing them to punish the poor but they are not outwith this world. The banking industry would rather the poor paid for their mistakes than they did. Therefore I don't believe suffering is predestined.  I can't say religion has helped me, really. It has made my OCD worse. So the knowledge that God may exist led to more suffering for me."

When you here of some of the things that humans do though its hard to believe that there isnt any evil influence. Charles manson and his satanic cult for example. At the end of the day they were known for devil worship and look at the acts they carried out. You could argue i suppose that they were all just mad and that there is no god and no devil its all made up.  People have different beliefs and debate is good. Nobody truely understands this confusing world and i can understand how religion can make things worse for people and confuse things further. If i were you though i wouldnt make the mistake of dismissing religion though altogether just because it increases symptoms. I noticed that at around the same time i started to think to myself there must be a god, theres more to life etc etc my anxiety and depression increased. Id question myself more, fear making mistakes, be anxious about picking the wrong faith/denomination etc but it hasn't taken away my belief of god."

When things are beyond our control we tend to blame those things for causing our worries. However, we control what we worry about by choosing to focus on those things. But we can control what we choose to focus on, thus changing the approach.  For example, if a man predisposed to anger is always blaming everyone else for making him angry he will likely stay frustrated and angry. However, if the man realizes that he has control over himself he changes his approach and the angry and frustration can change for the better. He starts recognizing what things trigger him and avoids them, better yet has a battle plan on how to deal with such situations when they arise. Someone is winding him up, he can allow the angry to influence his next step for the worst or choose to say something appropriate and walk calmly away - feeling very proud of himself that the situation did not rule him.

I thought if I didn't do them something bad would happen to me or someone else. Over time these feelings became rules for situations but I still had random feelings come into my head at times which I couldn't explain. They just appeared and I half believed they came from God. I knew it was silly but even now I still carry out the compulsions. I have rules too. A part of me believes that if I don't do these things a higher power will punish me. So religion hasn't helped me. I think if I could believe that God didn't exist I would be better. I wouldn't have any need to do the compulsions. But I do believe that there is something so I do the rituals. My belief in a higher power keeps me ill. I'm too afraid to try out not doing the compulsions because I don't want the bad things to happen. They are to do with the obsessions. Therefore fear and anxiety is caused by these beliefs.

I’ve struggled with anxiety for ages - longer than I’ve admitted until recently. I started a new job at the start of the year, and my anxiety/poor management/lack of clarity/lack of confidence is sending me into a bit of a spin.  I’ve also recently moved and so, I only just registered with a Doctor last week. I was trying to get an appointment to talk things through and hopefully get a prescription for antidepressants (I’ve tried counselling before and it’s not really helped) when all this covid-19 stuff kicked off.  I realise everyone is struggling to some degree at the moment, but I’m finding things so hard at the moment. I just called the doctor to try and get an appointment but they said they couldn’t help right now. That I should call back next week.  Was on a work call earlier, where I started crying (while I was muted!) because my anxiety got the better of me. That’s not normal is it?  I guess in the absence of a doctor’s appointment, I came on here looking for support/camaraderie/tips on how to cope.  As a consequence of this ongoing anxiety, I’ve had a headache for about a week and I’m knackered!  Thanks. All the best to you all"

I also signed up here after having my own anxiety severely triggered by the pandemic and have been regularly visiting. Without this dialogue I already know it would've been even tougher.  Talking and sharing your experiences is definitely the right thing to do. People like us with anxiety issues really struggle with a lack of certainty and the worry about what could come, so in a situation like this, which none of us could have imagined, we've been thrown into something that is just incredibly difficult to deal with. The whole world has been thrown into uncertainty, so it's unsettling to say the least to see those fears being played out on such a massive scale. This is a worrying time, it's unavoidable, and now we're having to try and come to terms with it.  I've been reading and listening to a lot of things during the past couple of weeks; I don't think I can post links but there's resources online, on Twitter even amongst the constant noise there, which are recognising ever more the toll this is taking on people's mental health, and are working to provide support. It's definitely worth looking around I'd say.  One thing which I've read and which I received advice about in the past (and which I'm desperately trying to do to limited success!), is to focus on the here and now: 'Am I safe at the moment?'. 'Is everything as it should be as I look around me right now?'. The answer I would hope is yes, so there is some certainty to hold on to.  And quickly on the subject of your doctor, have you asked to talk to them on the phone rather than having an appointment? That's what I did this week and within maybe an hour I was having a five minute chat and got a prescription for some medication. He was very understanding and said to ring again if/when I need to. Perhaps that could be an option for you?  All the best."

Before I had this support service in place, I was a virtual shut-in and now the world is in lockdown, it seems I'm going to return to being a shut-in once again. It is a shame they don't have more online counselling services through Skype or Zoom.

The first one - performance anxiety that included sexual performance anxiety (couldn't make it hard) that took me 4-5 months the get rid of and its I believe because I with the same girl for the past 3 years, I'm pretty sure that if I would need to be with new girl right now It will come back BIG TIME. another thing the I developed just in age 16-17 it's speech anxiety - I'm literally shacking everytime I need to read something in front of people, if its short for like few seconds I could do it but if its more than that I physically can't do it, even if I have the courage to try, I'm like run out of air to speak after few words. Before I will move to my second problem I just want to say that I not always was like that, I remember that as a child in elementary school I use to read in front all the school (around 200-300 people) without any problem.  My second problem - I'm really hypochondar and a lot of time I have certain symptoms I freak out and think I have some dangerous disease and start to imagine another symptoms. Also when I face a health problem (like the sexual performance anxiety) I think about it 24/7 and it really disturb me from living life normally and I'm in a deep depression until it really go away.   So that my main mental problems, I went to few sessions of therapy but the psychologist told me I have deep anxiety problem that I could solve maybe after few years of therapy and now I obviously don't have the money for it.  So to sum up my question is - can I solve my problems without help of therapist ? I don't care to read books, follow online programs or change daily habits of mine - anything to get rid of those problems.  Just want to say that I'm not going to try anti anxiety meds from my own reasons.

I have also suffered a previous Subarachnoid Brain Haemorrhage and having an episode of EHS can feel and sound like something quite serious however I suggest you speak to your medical practitioner to rule out a burst aneurism with CT/MRI scans if you are worried. What I can tell you is that there is unfathomable head pain plus projectile vomiting plus the crash in your head if you are having a bleed and EHS is painless but is very unsettling. EHS does still throw me off balance and it's scary for sure. Hope you get the right help x"

I have relapses quite a lot of times, and had quite a few rounds of inpatient when I was with CAMHS, and also when I was transferred to adults.  The past year I have been maintaining a healthy weight, so professionals think I'm 'getting better' and it's not an issue any more. but they way I eat and manage food and exercise is still very disordered.  TW. currently I tend to fast for two days so I eat nothing and do a lot of exercise but water and then massively overeat for one day, taking in far too many calories. but because overall it is about the same as my maintenance calories I don't gain or lose weight. I feel like I'm more satisfied because I can 'binge' on the day I do eat, and eat whatever the fuck I want but I know this is not normal and very disordered. and after I binge I feel horrendous, and I end up purging anyways not that I trigger myself to throw up but I'm so sick that I just gag.  and I know its not normal eating a whole cake in one sitting, and a whole ice cream tub, a whole packet of cereal and thing likes that. but I don't know whats going on.  my body image is ok.

That sounds basic for someone with an Ed, whether they think you're recovered or not, you obviously have problems eating and you should receive treatment for it.  Eating such amounts is dangerous so you should really get help right away and try to eat small meals but often; such as 5 times a day.

I have had an eating disorder since I was five (I’m now mid 20’s) which began with one of my friends playing a prank pretending a man was coming to get me. I was too scared to talk about it so not eating became a way of dealing with it. This went on throughout my teen years on and off until I went to college. I had control over my eating disorder, a few minor blips here and there but mostly under control. Then five years ago I was sexually assaulted by my brother in law and everything went down hill. I moved away from my family and lost control of my eating disorder again. I have now had to move back to my family due to work and I seem to be worse than ever. I am currently getting triggered by the smallest things, I could be having a great day about to make a healthy meal and feeling good then I could drop a fork on the floor and then that’s it I can’t eat. It’s nothing to do with what triggers me it’s just that I take that as a sign that I shouldn’t be eating today. I know this probably sounds bizarre and no one may have not experienced this before but I don’t understand why I’m doing it either. Any small/slight inconvenience and I just go into full panic mode and can’t seem to calm down and just spiral into a self hatred mess. I will be crying for hours and just be furious at myself because of my body and then get angrier at myself for letting it take over me again. My gp has said it’s to do with the assault and I’ve been assessed for therapy for that which is great long term but it doesn’t help when it’s happening and I’m panicking and can’t seem to bounce back.  Apologies for how long this is but I just wanted to give a bit of background. I just feel completely on my own with this and my family can’t understand why I’m hysterical over something so small and when I try to explain that it’s bigger than that I just feel stupid and lonely because they don’t get it. I’m just exhausted from constantly getting in these states, especially after being so positive about making food.

Although I'm still half a stone heavier than I was I still look the same and a bit gaunt in the photos, it seems like the only thing that actually got bigger was my stomach which I noticed, that makes me actually want to lose weight even more, I could get down to 10 1/2 stone maybe and the stomach might flatten even more, I've never been able to quite get rid of all of it, but a lot, however because I am 5ft 11 and male I'm worried that it doesn't make sense, and I get fed up with people saying that I'm underweight as when I was 16 stone last year and very overweight and a defo fatty, no one ever said anything! Can anyone explain why my weight suddenly rocketed up one stone when I first stopped the Christmas food. Does it make sense to lose even more weight or should I actually try to put some back on?

My hands are now blue and I have wounds all over them.

My doctor said I’ll end up having to cut of my fingers because they’ll rot if I don’t get my blood circulation going soon and I just can’t do this anymore. I’m too scared to increase my calories so I’ve been thinking about not doing my morning walk and just doing normal daily activities like going to the store and maybe going for a walk here and there WITHOUT decreasing my calories. So eating (moderated) calories and then doing normal daily activities without over excercising. I’m shit scared to gain weight by this since the thought that my metabolism has slowed down and gotten used to this haunts me (hence why I haven’t done this already) I’m scared that I’ll look at myself in the mirror the morning after doing this for one day and seeing my collarbones less visible and immidiately thinking I’ve gained weight and run back to what I’m doing now. I just don’t want to gain weight but I don’t want to lose either. I love food and eating and I’m willing to eat as much as I need to maintain my weight. I know that it’s hard for people seeing this to give answers without seeing me and also because you’re not medical professionals but from what I’ve said, do you think I will gain by doing what I’ve been thinking about doing? How many calories do you think I should eat to maintain this weight (keep in mind that my metabolism is very slow and I don’t want to gain weight at all)"

5553,Eating Disorders Forum,63275,New here......,2013-06-17T19:42:47+0100,author,True,28250,London,Belle22,"Hello,  I'm new to this forum and I hope it's okay to explain my story.  I was diagnosed with Anorexia at 13, and spent the majority of my teenage years in and out of general hospitals and backwards and forwards to CAMHS. Out-Reach team got involved when I was 17 and the Psychiatrist and the Therapist worked with myself and my family in our home. Things hit breaking point at 18 when I was admitted to an adult psychiatric unit (NHS) following an overdose. The Unit was absolutely terrible. There was no psychological support and I discharged myself.  CAMHS referred me to my local Eating Disorder Service when I was 18. I was seen by a Psychologist, a specialist nurse and dietician whilst studying for my A-Levels. Not much progress and I discharged myself when I went to University.  Whilst at University, I was seen by a nurse and monitored regularly by a Doctor. However, 2 months into my second year, I became unwell and had to return home. I took the year out and my GP referred me to an Eating Disorder team in London. I was put on the waiting list for CAT and worked with a therapist, although due to various health complications and operations, therapy was very disjointed we both came to the discussion that I had to get my physical health under control before engaging in therapy.  After about 3 months, my eating disorder and my mental health was getting worse and my GP referred me to my local eating disorder service. I had an assessment and they've suggested specialist supportive clinical management.  On top of the Anorexia, I suffer with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, Severe Endometriosis/chronic pain, PTSD, Osteopenia and Urological difficulties.  My Gynaecologist is putting my body through a temporary early menopause to try and help with the Endometriosis. I'm absolutely terrified as when I was taking the pill to help with the symptoms; I ended up taking lots of diuretics as felt so bloated all the time. I worry that this is just going to make my mood worse.  I'm struggling so much and I feel the NHS just don't know what to do with me. I've been unwell for nearly 11 years.  Do you think I should try and look at getting funding for private treatment?  Thank you for listening,  x"

I would strongly recommend(also read prod!) into talking to a supportive professional about it as my ""incident"" with the dietician was in 2007 and it still erodes my confidence. Do you have any support groups in your area that support recovery. It may help to have some face to face peer recovery. By all means, plz continue to receive support here but sometimes direct human support can be incredibly therapeutic.

I had a bad experience years ago, not quite rape but it terrified me. After I didnt want anyone to ever come near me again so I thought I should be as unattractive as possible. Stopped wearing make up, stopped dying my hair, started wearing baggy clothes and ate even when I didnt want to because I thought it would repel men. Now I have gained several stone, find myself disgusting but dont want to lose it because it makes me feel safer, I never get approached by men now and I like that. But on a personal level I feel disgusted with myself because its unnecessary to be this big, I find myself disgusting. I used to be a healthy weight and was happy I was being responsible for my health. I just cant win either way now."

There are probably more factors involved in the event prior then just body size that could maybe made you avoid it. Is change of body size really the most logical solution?

I have down played myself to be more safe, its a shame we gotta do it to feel safe but the world can be like so.  I think stopping in your case is tied to trying to overcome the fear of getting in trouble. Its your choice. What I meant in my first post is that there are a lot of other things you can do to be and feel safe other then make sure you are fat. And that fat also doesn't mean you will be free from trouble. But it depends of course what feels easier and what feels the least as a sacrifice. I'm just taking an example and not meaning you do just that, but maybe you rather go out toa club as fat and don't have to bother with looks and idiotic male behavior then try check all the other boxes on a long list to feel safe under such circumstance while fit and slim.  Personally I rather sit home feeling good about my body then being out feeling safe in my body. But we prioritize differently. Cause home at least for me is super safe.  I totally get that fat can be the easier out. In the end its your choice, neither is easy. And its sad that we gotta do things like this to cope with life."

I'm still struggling to gain to a healthy weight, and have recently taken a step back over and lost quite a bit. I've been trying to beat my anorexia for ten years now, so I have some idea of what it's like to relapse!  The thing is - and I hate to say this - anorexia can come back quite easily, if you allow it to by not paying attention to your thoughts and feelings, and by not seeking support when you need it most. I've been finding life really stressful but didn't really notice my thoughts about food, and didn't pay much attention to how I felt about it, and haven't spoken to anyone about my anorexia since February when I last saw my therapist...and look what's happened. I'm now below my half-way point between my lowest weight and my healthy weight, and it's happened in a very, very short space of time.  I'm not trying to scare you - really, I'm not - but it's well worth bearing in mind that the disordered thoughts might never leave you completely (I'm not sure mine will), and so a good, healthy life has to be based around very close attention to, and really good care of, your mental well being.  Think back to when you were at your most unwell, and think about how much choice you felt you had regarding whether or not you restricted your calorie intake on any particular day. Now, think about how things are at the moment - do you feel as though you've caught this at the point where it feels as though you still have a choice? It's best to nip these things in the bud, because I'm sure you know as well as I do just how quickly anorexia changes from being a way in which you control food and your body, to taking control of your life in the most frightening ways.  Have a ponder on what LittleElm said - sometimes the trigger goes unnoticed, and sometimes it can be a series of smaller triggers with a cumulative effect. Also, have you ever looked into Dialectical Behavioural Therapy? DBT is aimed at those with borderline personality disorder but, despite not having this disorder, I've found it very helpful in trying to deal with impulsive behaviours, including my eating habits. It's something I was roped into at the eating disorders unit, but ended up continuing because it was so helpful. I've been learning four modules - mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance - and all have been brilliant. Maybe you could have a google around for online resources, or maybe try to find a book about it?  I often like to step back and try to imagine what I would think if I were looking at myself and my situation in a scientific way; I imagine I'm watching myself for research purposes, try to work out why I behave in the way that I do, and try to draw conclusions from what I can see - from fact rather than feeling. It can be difficult but, once I got the hang of it, I found it very useful. It's easier if I refer to myself in the third person, e.g:  ""Smog is writing to Amber at the moment because she wants to help her to avoid falling into the trap into which she has fallen herself. Smog does this because she knows that this never ends well, despite how she feels at the moment"".  ^There, I've just been able to show myself that I'm aware that on some level, I don't want this.  ""Amber is reading Smog's post because she really doesn't want to be ill again and is reaching out for help"".  ^Here, I hope I have shown a similar thing; if you wanted to fall into this trap again, you wouldn't have posted...  ...so, please keep a very watchful eye on yourself, and take care of mental health as well as you possibly can. In the meantime, keep posting your thoughts and feelings. Sometimes even the act of writing or typing out what's going on in your mind can be helpful, but if you do that here, we will all help you to the best of our abilities.  xxx Smog."

Hello and I wish everyone well.  I'm trying to understand a situation which is triggering difficult feelings, and I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.  I had anorexia and then binge eating disorder when I was 16-20 years old. I'm now in my thirties and eat more or less normally.  But recently I've started to feel a lot more self-conscious and dissatisfied with my body shape, and feeling like I need to exercise more or change my eating habits.  I live with my sister who is very into fitness and working out. Due to the pandemic, she's working out at home now. She is smaller and thinner than me, and very fit. Now it's summer, she often walks round the house in a bikini. I wonder if she is judging me, because I'm not as thin and am not as strict with my diet as she is. She limits her carbohydrates and often eats just fruit for breakfast, for example, but I need something more substantial like porridge to give me energy. I'm taller and bigger built. My BMI is 22 or 23, so I'm a healthy weight but not skinny. I exercise every other day, but it's more to feel healthy and happy, than to try to achieve a particular body shape. I used to work out to try to change my body shape, but it never worked. I don't have the genetics to be the kind of shape that's considered ideal in society. Now I just wear quite loose clothes and focus on other areas of my life that I find much more interesting, like art.  When I'm around my sister, I wonder if I should be exercising more or eating differently. Also I wonder if she is judging my body and my eating habits. I can't really ask her, as we have quite a bad relationship, and I'd rather not talk about my insecurities with her.  I'm confused because I don't know if it's her who's trying to make me feel bad, or me who's being triggered. Sometimes for example, she walks round the house naked and doesn't put any clothes on when we need to talk. I think she enjoys getting attention for her appearance, as she often goes out to the shops wearing skintight clothes, which I wouldn't want to do. I'm more interested in art and meditation and find it boring to spend a lot of time on how I look. But now I'm feeling under pressure.  I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences, or understands this kind of thing?  Thanks for reading."

First of all, well done on having a healthier relationship with food. That is a huge thing after having an eating disorder. I have a binge eating disorder and your sisters behaviour would trigger me too. I can quite understand how you are starting to feel bad about yourself and if you should change things. You are now a healthy weight which is so positive. I know it is so hard to see somebody you feel looks ideal and compare yourself. Both my sisters are beautiful and slim. I am ugly and overweight and I feel so worthless next to them. I am really sorry you are feeling this way. It is all the worse because you live with her. You are you, not your sister.

I'm sorry to hear that you have a similar situation and that you're feeling bad. I wonder if there is something we can do to help ourselves feel better.  One thing that worries me is that I wonder if my sister is trying to make me feel bad on purpose. She and I have a bad relationship, and I wonder if she is deliberately trying to make my self esteem worse, or whether she would be doing the same behaviours even if I didn't live with her. I can't talk about it with her, because if she knew I was feeling bad because of this, she might do it more. I feel a bit helpless to change the situation.  I was wondering if there is anything to do to protect myself, if she is deliberately trying to make me feel bad. I once read a saying, 'if there's no enemy within, then external enemies can't harm you.' I've been trying to think of ideas to help myself, and perhaps they might help you too. Maybe you have some ideas.  - Focus more on my own personal goals. I am trying to start out as a professional artist. - Look for images of role models who don't have an 'ideal body'. I don't know ANY artists I admire who look as though they've been working out a lot. None of them look like 'gym types' with big muscles. All the artists I admire have 'normal' bodies, and some of them are overweight, and their body shape is never in my mind at all when I'm looking at their work. Maybe I could collect photos of my favourite artists, and make a collage. - When lockdown ends, spend more time with my friends who don't care about my body weight. - Maybe don't go to the gym any more, or just go once a week, and exercise outdoors on other days. I used to go to the gym a few times a week, and I found it triggering because I would compare my body to others' bodies. When I went just once a week, and did running outdoors on other days, I felt better.  Those are some ideas. Do you have any other ideas on how we can protect ourselves and help ourselves? I want to get strong inside, so that other people's behaviour won't affect me. I can't control my sister's behaviour, I can only control my reaction."

I really hope she is not because her behaviour is cruel. I love your ideas of how to improve self worth. I have a few people on youtube whose videos I watch because they have a body more like mine. They make fashion videos and it is lovely to see them being confident in their body without having to live up to a certain standard. Your idea of looking for others with a similar body is great. It is shown that people who look at bodies that are not like theirs end up feeling really worthless.  I am glad you have friends. I hope you can see them once lockdown ends. It is good to surround yourself with positive people. If the gym triggers you then you are sensible to avoid it. You sound like you have a lot of insight into how you feel and what can help.

I'm interested to hear more about the people who you watch on YouTube. What are their names? You mentioned that they are confident in their bodies. I think it seems that body confidence doesn't depend on what size a person is. Someone could have a body that most people would say is very attractive, yet that person could always be looking for flaws, and feel dissatisfied. Or someone could be very overweight and yet radiate confidence.  I've been thinking about this topic a lot, and I've come to the conclusion that I can't possibly know whether or not my sister is trying on purpose to make me feel bad. Trying to answer this question just makes me feel stressed. I think it would be more helpful if I acknowledged that another person's behaviour is out of my control, and I can't know their motives without being able to see inside their mind. I think it would be better if I focused on what I can change: my own attitude towards my body. I think this whole situation has made me realise that I have unfinished business in my relationship with my body, despite that I thought I had already recovered from the eating disorder. I will make an effort to look for information on ways of changing my relationship with my body.  Thanks for your thoughts. I hope you find helpful ways of working through your own situation."

I wish you lots of luck with working towards your goal."

I will have a look.  Thanks for the kind words. It's nice of you to say that I'm strong. In the past, my sister has said that I'm weak, because I've needed a low dose of antidepressants for several years to help me sleep. I didn't want to go on them, but at the time I didn't know what else to do - I couldn't sleep properly at all, and I was teaching at the time, so I needed to be able to sleep so that I could stand in front of a class and do my job. I'm gradually withdrawing from the antidepressants now. I had some very good online therapy on the NHS called Silvercloud - I recommend it to anyone struggling with sleep. And I've been learning to meditate for the last two years which helps as well. But my sister used to make unhelpful comments, e.g. that I was 'addicted to drugs' and that I was weak. So it's nice that you think I am strong.  I think it's futile to try to change another person, in most cases. It can be very stressful to wish they were different. That's why I want to try to work on my own relationship with my body. If I can build my own self esteem, then I can just tell myself that the other person's comments aren't true. It also helps to get objective feedback from an outsider, like on this forum. Thank you."

I really feel a lot better for having talked with you. Thanks for your support and understanding.  I wasn't actually diagnosed with depression: the doctor prescribed me antidepressants because of their sedative effect, to help me sleep. My sister was criticising me because she didn't think that I needed them. But I think you should walk a mile in someone's shoes before judging them.  I was wondering if you have any ideas on how I can try not to let my sister's behaviour get to me (when she's making comments or behaving in ways that I think are meant to put me down).  One idea I had was to practise telling myself that if someone is trying to put another person down, then that person is probably suffering in some way, feeling bad about themselves, and is trying to put another person down to make themselves feel better. So if my sister tries to put me down, I can tell myself that the comments or behaviour aren't about me: they're a reflection of how she's feeling. I can try to develop a stronger sense of who I am and my strong points, which I can remind myself of after a difficult interaction. Seeing people who I get on with, who reflect back a positive view of me, will help after the lockdown ends. It's difficult because sometimes her behaviour makes me doubt myself, or develop a distorted view of myself, like a reflection in a wavy mirror at a funfair. I think self esteem is the way one sees oneself. I want mine to be as objective and fair as possible. I will need to work on it.  I'm trying to start out as a professional artist, and sometimes I tell myself that learning these skills will enable me to develop a thicker skin, which will be useful when I start exhibiting and getting criticism.  Ultimately I hope that with time, our relationship will improve. Trying to be compassionate and to see things from my sister's point of view might help. But if she is being deliberately hurtful, I will set a boundary and not be close to her."

Your idea of rethinking the way you feel due to her comments is positive. Would you ever try sticking up for yourself?

I think that you're a very good listener. It's difficult talking with my sister. Often when I mention something that she has done that has hurt my feelings, she turns it round and makes it seem that I am the one who has done something wrong. Or she says that I am 'playing the victim'. Sometimes I get confused, and don't know who is in the right and who is in the wrong. Sometimes, if I phrase things very carefully, and choose a moment where she is in a good mood, she is able to listen, and has apologised. I think I'm getting better at choosing my moments, with time and experience. I might look for a counsellor or therapist who could help me with my relationship with my sister. It doesn't always bother me, and often we are able to coexist normally, but sometimes it gets to me that she often seems to be in a bad mood with me. For example, if I'm in the kitchen and she comes in and wants to prepare food, she sometimes gets annoyed that I'm already there, as she likes to have the room to herself. I just finish what I'm doing calmly, as I know I've done nothing wrong: she's simply being impatient."

It's really important to me to have as much time as possible for my art.  Most of the time I hardly see my sister, as she stays in her room. She doesn't go out of her way to interact with me.

It's helpful that there are ratings for each organistion.

She gave me a list of places I could look for therapy that's charged according to income. I admit that I haven't yet taken action, as I feel a bit overwhelmed by the number of options, and there are so many therapists out there but no way of knowing who would be able to help me. But I've been helping myself by meditating every day.  I had a conversation with my sister yesterday, about a subject that's been bothering me (not the same subjects we've been discussing here) and the conversation was actually very positive. I hope that the situation can improve: even though I don't think my sister will ever be a 'friend', I think there are ways we can cooperate.

I just wanted to say, in case anyone reads this and is looking for something that helps, that learning to meditate is probably the best decision I made for my mental health. If anyone else is thinking of trying it, I can say it's definitely worth it, in my experience at least. I learned to meditate with an app called Headspace, but probably there are lots of other methods out there.  I'm still having trouble with my sister. This evening, my mother was just about to go into the kitchen and cook herself a meal, when my sister came downstairs and announced that she was cooking. My sister likes to have the kitchen all to herself when she cooks, and so usually she cooks at 8pm, so my mother and I know that we need to have finished by then. But it was 7.30 when my sister came to the kitchen this evening. My mum let her go ahead, and said that she'd wait. I thought this was unfair, and said to my mum that I thought she should say something to my sister. My mum isn't very firm, and my sister's a bully IMHO. But my mum wouldn't say anything. I went into the kitchen and said to my sister that I thought she should allow our mum to share the kitchen, if she wants to cook before 8pm. My sister got angry, said I was being 'OCD', and was angry with me for getting involved in an issue that was between herself and mum. Was I wrong to have said something? I said 'I just saw something unfair happening, so I thought I'd say something.'  Now she's going around the house in a happy mood, while I'm still upset. I don't think I did anything wrong - did I? Whenever I raise anything with my sister, she turns it around and makes it look as though I'm the bad one. Sometimes I wonder if she has mild narcissistic personality disorder, as I've read that some of the symptoms are anger, bullying, shifting the blame and so on.  Really upset. I wouldn't have got involved at all, but my mum wasn't willing to say anything, and I couldn't stand by and watch my sister bullying her. My sister is living under my mum's roof rent-free (as I am) so I think she should treat my mum with more respect."

Click to expand...  Hello! I've read your first few messages, before skipping forward for an the update.  I'm glad to hear you were eventually able to talk to your sister, but it's unfortunate that not much has changed since.  I can't say for certain whether or not she's is doing this specifically to get under your skin, only she will know that unless she says it outright. Regardless, she is allowed to exercise and eat when and how she wants, so long as she's going about it in a healthy manner. I want to congratulate you on being this far into recovery. I'm currently struggling with a lot of disordered eating habits myself, and it's definitely a monster to try and break away from. The fact that you've done so is admirable, and you should be extremely proud of your progress.  It's absolutely understandable that you would be triggered by your sisters actions. I think the list of ideas you wrote out are excellent. I've always found that when I'm working on important independent projects, other people's actions matter less to me because I know I'm accomplishing something worthwhile. I think pursuing your art especially is a great avenue to explore.  I also think talking with your therapist about specific situations that arrive in your household will be an excellent idea. Therapists are great at offering a neutral and unbiased perspective, and will help you examine any situation from the outside in. At no point did I feel as though you were in the wrong or being unfair in your posts, you definitely seem to be the victim, and your sister the instigator. Being able to process this alongside of a professional will be a huge aid in your mental health journey.  Best of luck!"

Bpd, how did you find your telephone therapist? Was it through the link you sent me a few posts ago? Telephone therapy sounds a great idea. I think I've been putting off looking for therapy because I didn't want to travel somewhere, which would take away some of my painting time. I'd just have to make sure I do it at a time when other people in the house wouldn't be able to hear the phone conversation. Or I could go and sit in the garage.  Lyesander, thanks for your thoughts on the situation. I'm sorry to hear that you're having a lot of trouble with disordered eating habits. I wouldn't say that I'm totally free of them myself, they're just at a low level now and I'm able to live my life without them impacting me too much. Quite often I feel guilty after eating, or wonder if I've eaten too much, but having a focus on art helps me care about my weight less. Where there's life, there's always hope for change, and I hope you will see change too.  It's very helpful to get an outside perspective, because my sister is very clever at arguing that I'm in the wrong. She is having therapy herself, and is familiar with a lot of the terminology, so for example she'll say I'm being 'passive aggressive' even when I've tried to be as objective and neutral as possible, or that I'm 'triangulating' (she is likely to use that about what happened yesterday) or that I'm 'playing the victim'. When she comes up with things like that, it makes me question myself. But sometimes it's so obviously wrong that it's easy to see through it - for example, yesterday she said I was being 'OCD' for mentioning that she was cooking at a different time, but I know it wasn't about that at all - my issue was that if you want the kitchen to yourself, then changing your cooking time without warning affects others.  Thanks both of you for your ideas and for reading my posts."

We both work from home, thankfully in separate rooms, and most days it's OK and we are able to coexist. I don't let her close to me, talk about anything personal or anything like that. I keep her at a distance emotionally. But I'm willing to put bad things that happen behind me, to make life easier. I feel I have a duty to be able to coexist peacefully with family, and she and I have responsibilities that we share, and it will be the same throughout our lives - we will have to discuss different family-related things - so I can't cut off contact with her.

It's quite worrying really, if this is what my sister is doing. I'm not that good at understanding people's psychology, and it sounds complex what she is doing, turning things round, refusing to accept blame, devaluing my feelings and so on. For a long time I've just been used to her behaving like this. I wonder if it has affected my self esteem in the long run, or whether I'd be further on in life if I hadn't been treated like this. But I can't afford to think about what might have been, I can only work with things as they are. I could say that anything might have been."

I would think your sisters behaviour has impacted your self esteem. If you are always being dismissed and blamed it is bound to have an effect.

5613,Eating Disorders Forum,7787,Amenorrhea,2009-12-05T13:09:40+0000,author,True,3706,"London, UK",swan,I was just curious as to whether anyone has experienced amenorrhea (periods stopping) due to not eating enough/being too underweight? I was worried it may have been the case for me until my period finally came last night but it still had me panicking that it could stop or become really irregular. Is there a certain BMI that would trigger the onset amenorrhea or is it more based on the amount of calories you're eating?

My last relapse my periods stopped pretty shortly after starting to lose weight and I didn't get them back until I reached BMI 17-18. I didn't have them for 2 years or so I think.  At different times in your life I think your body allocates its resources differently, who knows. I also think other factors in your life such as stress can have an effect."

I now have osteopoenia a pre-cursor to osteoporosis. Womens abilities to absorb calcium in their bones rely on a level of hormones. If your periods stop is likely your bones will suffer.  It can also effect your fertility. One girl I know who suffered with an eating disorder had an ovarian scan and was told this by the nurse ""your ovaries have packed their cases and will never come back"". She was still very young. She will never be able to have children.  If your periods stop or become irregular and you are underweight, then it is a sign that things are not right at all. I would get some help with it if you haven't already. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate than any other mental illness. They shouldn't be taken lightly."

I have never got any support for it.  When I was about 8 or 9, I started gaining weight and since then I have been obese. I used to eat a lot for a child and this was kind of encouraged by my mum. She used to feed me a lot more than my sister's. I always had the extra snack or the extra plate of food. By the time I was a teenager I was obese. I was bullied a lot because I was obese but I was also quite tall. I stuck out like a sore thumb. I had trouble controlling my eating habits through college and university. I tried a lot of Fad diets but none worked. I grew anxious with my weight gain, and never really left the house to socialise. Even when relatives would visit I'd lock myself in my room. I ate 24 hours round the clock. I never really slept either which didn't help. I was hungry all the time.  When I reached the age of 23 I was very overweight. I said enough was enough. That I was going to get on a diet and get fit. I got on a diet and within 7 months I lost a lot of weight. I lost a stone a month. I became obsessed with being skinny. I ate 1 meal a day, and I exercised 2 to 3 hours per day. But I never really tackled by eating disorder. I only made it worse. Of course I still had an insatiable appetite.  I didn't care though, I was skinny and people were praising my new look. I was happy until I got ill. I grew weak, I got dizzy spells, I fainted, my hair started to fall out. I knew why. Luckily this wasn't sustainable. I would go on holiday and let go for a week. When I'd return I couldn't pull myself back into the gym, I could Carey on this diet and within 6 months I would have gained back every pound I lost. I was obese again and now everyone would look at me like a failure. I failed at being healthy. I wasn't healthy when I was skinny, I was only causing my body further stress and illness. Now I am above 19 stones in weight, with back problems, and early osteoarthritis. I hate myself, I'm embarassed, I cry to myself, I feel pathetic. I just wanted to be accepted and to be fit and healthy. It didn't happen."

I also binge eat it's a self-soothing coping mechanism for me.  I just wanted to tell you there is no shame in this and no one ever was successful in shaming themselves into being a better person.  Personally I never found dieting helpful because it doesn't address the issue only the outcome. Cognitive therapy and self love and acceptance work proved far more helpful and effective.  I suggest you read some works by writer Roxane Gay who has many good words to share about the matter of being you in a world that sees only your weight.

Dont worry about it honey, whats done is done, atleast you made an effort and you did good today yeah? and you realise that you do need help but you need to try and think why do you feel so guilty about having the food in your body. Ok il let you in on a little secret that keeps me going. Basically when you starve yourself your body begins to eat away at your muscle yeah. so you do lose weight but your mostly losing muscle weight. When you eat and exercise the energy goes to your muscles so that you have the basic energy to go about day to day things. When you eat AND exercise the energy goes to your muscle and fat gets burned and not muscle. You lose weight but you lose the fat. So basically when you see children in africa dying of starvation and they cant move its simply because their bodys just lost all the muscle and they have no energy income whatsoever. The thing that inspires me recently dear, is the fact i dont want health problems when im in my 20's and 30's. I dont want to damage my intestines, i dont want to get kidney failure, go on dyalisis or a waiting list for a kidney. i dont want my brain to not function right. i dont want my hair to fall out. im being honest here and i dont want to upset you but you need to realise your seriously harming yourself. you may not feel like you are harming yourself hell you might even feel great for losing a few pounds but really its not worth it at all. Please stop, now that im eating ive been vomiting daily for a long time.. it can be really hard to keep food down naturally. when i eat i have to wait a few minuites before another bite else it will just come up and i cant fill myself up. Its getting better though. Only now have i realised how much ive harmed myself. i feel more energetic. i feel like i could run a marathon. Dont feel guilty. eat the right things and continue your exercise and you will feel better. You wont feel this way anymore.. all the bad thoughts... the guilt.. the shame.. they go away after a while. you just need to keep the food down I promise you... they will go away."

At the time I had just started on antidepressents as I was having a really hard time and broke down in school.  When I went to the eating disorder clinic I was given a pdoc, who assed me first, like bmi, and how I was feeling, she was very nice. A few weeks later I had a bone density scan, which reviled I had very weak bones, so that's kinda scary. after about 2 weeks of seeing her, I went once a week, I got a dietition and counsellor. The dietition was useless, like I knew what to eat, I was just terrified of eating it! When I fist went there, I was a vegan and living on veg and fruit, as I didn't like nuts and wouldn't eat any fat. I'm not sure how you feel about getting better? But for me, I wanted to get help, as I wanted to be normal. By this stage I had lost my best (and only) friend as we had had a big augment where she told me I was just doing for attention, which was totally untrue.  I think a big trigger for me wanting to get better was going on a scuba diving holiday, but was so skinny that none of the suits fitted me and I was SO cold. I mean like crying, wanting to die cold. I also couldn't socialise with the other girls as there was no way I could have drunk the calories in the cocktails they drunk. So I realised then I was totally missing out on so much. I think to truly get better you need to be in right mind set and really want to do it for you.  But when I first went there I was scared, not so much about putting on weight, as I knew that would have to happen, more about not being able to stop putting on weight when I had got to a healthy level. Because online it says all about how it damages your metabolism. I took me a few months to get over that.  My pdoc said that if I lost any more weight I would have to go into hospital, and a few days later, I just started to eat, and eat and eat. I felt so out of control. Like I put on weight so fast. But then I stabilised out as a weight I am happy with.  The counselling was good, but I only went to the clinic for a few months, as I then went to uni and I really think I need to go back to therapy, as I never got to the root of my issues, and they are still there, but in a different form, so I recommend staying with it.  I wouldn't advise putting on weight as fast as I did, but I just wanted to get it over with, but I think slow and steady is better.  Sorry it such a ramblly post, if I havn't answered you, just say. :hug1 Sorry I can't give you so much detail on going to the clinic, I have total brain fog from that period."

If you are moderately active, a woman of your height would need to eat approx 1800 Kcalories per day If you eat less than this you will not have a BMI of 18.

My habits are getting better and I'm very positive not to let myself get bad again but I've read a very good book, Gillian Riley- Eating Less- say goodbye to overeating, its based upon increasing your confidence around food, although a lot of it is based on self-reward and confidence, and thats quite difficult when you're suffering with depression. I've found if i start to feel down and the need to eat comfort foods i have to keep myself busy, and the best way to do that is just to get out the house and go for a small walk in time any problems can be overcome, best of luck!x"

What makes me even more angry is the fact that they also drag other people into their sites who do not have an eating disorder, and then encourage them to start using these negative behaviours.  Scrolling through the Internet, there are so many of these websites and I think it's just disgusting that Internet moderators aren't doing more to get these sites taken down.

I was then put on Abilify which is an antipsychotic (why I was ever put on this I still don't know)! A few weeks went by and then I noticed my weight starting to increase. As if that wasn't enough I then started to eat more in the evening which progressed to binging large amounts until i almost felt sick! What was worrying was that I just couldn't resist binging. I tried to fight it but there was nothing I could do. I was eating large amounts of chocolate, cereals, and bread with lashings of peanut butter and jam on it, thick slices and all. In fact anything that was around. To try to curb my weight gain I started to eat nothing for breakfast and dinner, but I was still gaining weight, and so I decided that I couldn't look at my scales anymore. However I got to about 13 stone 8lb and realised that the Abilify had to be something to do with it, so after ringing the psychiatrist who told me that Abilify doesn't cause weight gain at all (very helpful lol), I decide to cut down and come off Abilify and within weeks I was able to think about dieting again. Also, I have now come off Citalopram which has made it even easier to lose weight. I am about half way there now. I weighed 12 stone 13lb this morning and I need to get to 12 stone 7lb. I have now changed my psychiatrist. I don't think I really need either of those drugs, especially the Abilify.

But I am currently 25 years old and have finally thought to myself that rather than being lazy and undisciplined, I may actually have an eating disorder.  I guess I will start with my teenage years. As a teenager, I used to overeat massively to the point where, by the age of 18, I was nearing 100kg. This is way too much for somebody that is 5'2. If I were to describe the binge eating, it would usually be solitary and followed by crying and some form of self-harm. I won't go into detail about that. I had a friend at that time that was diagnosed with anorexia and we would often talk about things. I broached the topic and told her I think I have a problem with eating; once I broke it down for her she suggested that I just lacked self-control. Now that I am older, I understand her train of thought given her own issues. I was also in therapy at the time and my therapist recommended I spoke with my GP about it, which I did. I was referred to a dietician who did the usual spiel about portion control and exercise etc. This was, of course, of no help.  Fast forward to when I turn 18, my family decided it was time to do something about my weight so I had a gastric band operation. Since then I have lost considerable weight, now weighing 67kg. I constantly get compliments from people in my life about how much better I look etc. The only issue is, this makes me so angry because nothing has changed. I still loathe myself and spend so much of my time thinking about how big and undesirable I am. The bingeing also has not stopped. Of course, the band has restricted how much food I can actually take in, but I still have my 'sessions' in which I eat until I am uncomfortably full. The only difference now is that I will automatically throw up because of the band. I've also developed a few techniques that speed up this process with the band, as strange as this sounds. Once I have thrown up, I will just continue eating then throw up again until the food is finished. I have also noticed that these sessions will always contain very specific foods like a ritual. It's usually KFC, two pieces of chicken, four hot wings, the supercharger sauce, a can of pepsi, then from dominoes their cookies and a tub of ben and jerrys chocolate fudge brownie. It will always be this combination. Well I do actually have a few set go to combinations but that is the primary one. I will always eat in the same order, and in the same way, which has led me to believe its like a ceremony. Then afterwards I will cry and hate myself. I don't engage in the more typical forms of self harm anymore (although I guess this could be considered self harm) however I will spend a good while afterwards fighting the urge to do so.  It has been pretty hard even entertaining the thought that I may have an eating disorder because all my life I have been told it is about exercise and discipline. But after having the operation I have become sure that it is a sign of something else. The impact it has had on my life and health - my inability to eat with others, the damage to my throat, my up and down weight and the emotional toll - has forced me to reckon with the fact that this is a problem. It is difficult to talk to others about this because people usually think anorexia or bulimia when you talk about eating disorders, and I am no longer as worryingly obese as I was before for one to be concerned about binge eating.  I guess I just wanted to see if anybody has had a similar experience or would have some advice. In all honesty, I have a very bad relationship with my GP and, as of now, do not want to broach the subject with them; there are way too many things for me to sort out. I do currently have a therapist that I am trying to work on general emotional issues with to see if that will alleviate anything, but only time will tell how that goes.  All the best,  Susu"

If I were to describe the binge eating, it would usually be solitary and followed by crying and some form of self-harm. I won't go into detail about that. I had a friend at that time that was diagnosed with anorexia and we would often talk about things. I broached the topic and told her I think I have a problem with eating; once I broke it down for her she suggested that I just lacked self-control. Now that I am older, I understand her train of thought given her own issues. I was also in therapy at the time and my therapist recommended I spoke with my GP about it, which I did. I was referred to a dietician who did the usual spiel about portion control and exercise etc. This was, of course, of no help.  Fast forward to when I turn 18, my family decided it was time to do something about my weight so I had a gastric band operation. Since then I have lost considerable weight, now weighing 67kg. I constantly get compliments from people in my life about how much better I look etc. The only issue is, this makes me so angry because nothing has changed. I still loathe myself and spend so much of my time thinking about how big and undesirable I am. The bingeing also has not stopped. Of course, the band has restricted how much food I can actually take in, but I still have my 'sessions' in which I eat until I am uncomfortably full. The only difference now is that I will automatically throw up because of the band. I've also developed a few techniques that speed up this process with the band, as strange as this sounds. Once I have thrown up, I will just continue eating then throw up again until the food is finished. I have also noticed that these sessions will always contain very specific foods like a ritual. It's usually KFC, two pieces of chicken, four hot wings, the supercharger sauce, a can of pepsi, then from dominoes their cookies and a tub of ben and jerrys chocolate fudge brownie. It will always be this combination. Well I do actually have a few set go to combinations but that is the primary one. I will always eat in the same order, and in the same way, which has led me to believe its like a ceremony. Then afterwards I will cry and hate myself. I don't engage in the more typical forms of self harm anymore (although I guess this could be considered self harm) however I will spend a good while afterwards fighting the urge to do so.  It has been pretty hard even entertaining the thought that I may have an eating disorder because all my life I have been told it is about exercise and discipline. But after having the operation I have become sure that it is a sign of something else. The impact it has had on my life and health - my inability to eat with others, the damage to my throat, my up and down weight and the emotional toll - has forced me to reckon with the fact that this is a problem. It is difficult to talk to others about this because people usually think anorexia or bulimia when you talk about eating disorders, and I am no longer as worryingly obese as I was before for one to be concerned about binge eating.  I guess I just wanted to see if anybody has had a similar experience or would have some advice. In all honesty, I have a very bad relationship with my GP and, as of now, do not want to broach the subject with them; there are way too many things for me to sort out. I do currently have a therapist that I am trying to work on general emotional issues with to see if that will alleviate anything, but only time will tell how that goes.  All the best,  Susu Click to expand... Hi susu469 I’m very sorry to hear that you have been struggling with this but I completely understand what you are going through as it has been my reality ever since I was little.  I have been to many GPs and they have all told me the same thing as well; a diet and exercise will fix everything. Recently I have had an upper endoscopy and they found that I had GERD and a hiatal hernia, all due probably to my binge eating. The gastroenterologist told me the same thing; I just need to lose weight with exercise and eat a balanced diet.  The thing is that I am also depressed which causes me to be really unmotivated and unable to leave the house so exercise for me is incredibly hard and eating a balanced diet seems impossible because I always give up and binge.  My parents have also been not very understanding in terms of my situation as they believe that I am just lazy and with a diet and exercise I’ll lose some weight. The thing is with an eating disorder, that’s just not how it works, and I know due to the countless times I have tried to restrict what I was eating, only to end up binging again.  In terms of advice, what has really helped me is seeing a therapist, as it helps with uncovering why you binge and it’s really nice having someone to talk to. The thing is, results are not gonna appear instantly and although it is hard because you want to heal right away, I keep reminding myself that you need to give yourself time. Another thing that I do is I try to keep myself occupied, something which I struggle with due to depression, but I’ve noticed that if I try my best to focus on soemthing, I’ll be less likely to binge."

As such it can easily give us pleasure and comfort from bad experiences etc, perhaps a sort of self-reward... I find eating slower, gives me greater satisfaction from my eating experiences, and we can consume less calories in the process. There are also other ways to reward ourselves/take our minds of negative/bad experiences. Also cutting out all the toxic from our lives has got to have a positive impact on our quality of life. The problem with feeling guilt/shame from over-eating is it can make us even more upset/depressed than we were before reaching out for that fix, and it can become a vicious circle. The cycle needs breaking and possibly the association of using food as a form of comfort also needs to change... Maybe exercising will also help burn off those extra calories (but if someone isn't feeling good about themselves, there tends to be little or no motivation to do so)... Hope this helps"

I think eating more slowly will help. I'm trying to be realistic. My special food is chocolate and something I buy daily and eat secretly. My therapist has said that it all comes down to self esteem- we are talking about things from my past which has brought up lots of questions for me and how I live and want to be as a person. I think I need to not put too much pressure on myself and take it a day at a time. I would love to be one of these people that sticks to routine, exercises regularly and eats well but it never seems to happen that way for me- I go through phases and my weight goes up and down. I worry mostly with my weight now as I want to get my body healthy in the hope that myself and my husband try for children next year. Maybe I need to remember my end goal. Thinking out loud!

I don't do it because I have a fear of gaining weight, or that I feel i'm fat; I literally do it because I find it gives me a sense of relief. I don't do it after meals; generally what I do is when I'm feeling numb I eat loads and loads of food and make myself sick. I find that it's better than crying; because I feel weak when I cry, but when I purge food I don't feel weak, I feel in control. It also brings me back to reality, and stops my feelings of numbness.  I'm starting to realise that I need to stop doing this and find a better way of coping (however purging food is my subsitute to selfharm.)  I've never told anybody this before, despite being an inpatient at an adolescent psychiatric ward for the past two years. I've always found this quite a personal subject; but I'd like to get help with it.  Is there a particular name for this kind of behaviour?

I am not a doctor and this is my opinion only, but what you describe, the release/relief, the sense of control, are all classic symptoms of bulimia...... Do you want things to change, because if so you will need to go and talk to a health professional about it. I do the same thing....so do lots of us, so we will try to understand as much as we are able. For me, throwing up is a replacement for SH , in fact it is just another way of SHing...... It is possible to change and to give up the impulses around SH etc but most of us need the support and guidance of a specialist therapist in order to do this. In the unit you mention I can imagine there is a member of staff who is a specialist, can you find out who it might be and talk to them?

Story in short:  recovered from anorexia Feb this year re-built my life, new career, big pay break, social scene etc relapsed May this year - lost weight 7 weeks ago I tried to take my life & ended up in a coma for 2 days in the ICU Currently on home leave from psych ward for 1 week & discharge mtg on Thursday  Being inpatient on a general psych ward was terrible as they couldnt support me with my eating & I lost further weight. Now on home leave I spend 1 week just numb with no emotion what so ever and constantly binging (which is something I have never done) I binged constantly for the whole of last week.  Come this week, I obviously feel so guilty from last week I am a total mess. All of the thoughts and feelings that bought me to my overdose have come back in full force. I just feel so unsupported by my ED team who couldn't fit me in this week or help me plan out something to help me whilst I have been at home. I feel like I am bobbing along with my head just above the water and I might drown at any time. I'm so scared, blank and just feel pointless really.  Please tell me that this eating disorder isn't forever, it's taken every aspect of my life away from me."

ED are the result of ""being a prisoner of your own mind."" Especially anorexia. There is no reason to ever restrict your own food intake, it is a form of self punishment. Why we feel we need to do that is a mystery, somehow we learned to believe that we don't deserve better. Meaning, a healthy proper diet. Also the fear of being fat in our society has become a bit ridiculous, which doesn't help either. To break out of the cycle you have to convince yourself that you deserve to be happy and healthy. And you have to also be convinced that a healthy diet will not lead to excessive fat gain. One of the allure's to anorexia is that it gives one a strong sense of control when they feel as though the rest of the things in their lives are out of control. So to let go of that control need, one has to either learn to deal with life when it seems out of control or gain control over other aspects of ones life.  What I said above may not be all that helpful, because I don't know the details of your situation, but these are just some general ideas about EDs that seemed to be helpful to some people in the past. I hope there are some other people on this forum that can share their ideas and/or support for you. No one deserves to suffer with an ED, so I hope things get better for you soon."

I've been struggling with disordered eating (periods of binge eating and fasting/restrictive food intake, fluctuating weight, body image issues) since I was 14 (now 19), and for the past few months I have been throwing up my food multiple times a day. With being quarantined things have gotten worse, as I have all the time in the world to focus on food. However, I'm aware of my problem and will seek help as soon as this COVID 19 situation is over. On the other hand, I'm very worried about my little 12 year old sister. I've been living with my parents and siblings now as we were sent home from college, and I have noticed my little sister being obsessed with food and weight and workout. I have caught her throwing up after meals (I am the only one to have noticed this), weighing herself and doing excessive squats (and some other workouts). I confronted her about it in a friendly, chill way, and after a long conversation about the dangers of purging, she admitted to throwing up after meals if she felt like she had eaten too much, and wanting to be thin like a ""K-pop-star"". She made me promise to not tell our parents (I have to tell them, obviously). What advice should I give to my parents? And how can I help my sister?"

The lightheadedness could be dehydration from purging and exercising i know i get it quite a bit so i drink a combination of juice and water. I know that vomiting blood cant be good. it could be from your throat though. being sick can irritate it and plus if you use an object or your nails scratch your throat. If its from your stomach it cant be good at all. there are cases where bulimics can get ruptured stomachs. Really all i can say is what helps me when i vomit is having some ice cold water. it soothes my throat and hydrates my body from the lost fluid. You really could do with some more nutrition. if i have to eat when im struggling i will make myself a few vegtables or something just to keep away the pains.

I don't think that the people engaging in this behaviour often realise the full implications of it all - People often die; & often people end up with very ill health for the rest of their lives; & often cause themselves severe & long lasting brain damage.  It's sad - because so often this drastic weight loss seems to be talked about in such a nonchalant & blasé way - 'I need to lose 'X' amount of weight to fit into my dress' - or 'I'm not eating the rubbish my parents feed me' - It comes across like people are playing some kind of a game? & I've seen it with other people that I've known in my own life too.

No one would be able to tell the difference between someone with a BMI of 18, & 18.75, just by looking at them  To maintain a BMI of 18.0 a woman of your height would need to eat at least 1400 Kcalories per day, even if you do no physical activity. If you are moderately active, a woman of your height would need to eat approx 1800 Kcalories per day If you eat less than this you will not have a BMI of 18. So you need to eat between 1400 & 2200 Kcalories per day somehow.  (This assumes that you dont have any medical conditions that alter your metabolism)  I agree that a dietician or nutritionist would be a good idea but there are good ones & bad ones so you may need to try more than 1  If you continue your starvation diet, you will probably make worse your other conditions (eg arrhythmia)  Assuming there is no other cause for your gas & pain from eating, you may just have to put up with it, or try & find foods that dont have that effect.

When you dont eat for a period of time its just bad. Adults gradually lose stomach acid as we get older and basically by not eating right this will cause maldigestion and promotes the symptoms of gas, bloating, acid reflux and heartburn. Whats really going on in your stomach is not too much acid its the fermentation of undigested foods. that fermentation produces large amounts of gas that push stomach acid and food back up the esophagus. another problem might be chest pains but in your case abdominal pains from too much gas. This condition is actually coming from your small intestine, not your stomach. The undigested fermenting food caused by a lack of stomach acid, poor food combinations and improper chewing has finally been flushed down from the stomach into the small intestines.it basically continues to ferment causing even more gas due to the fact that it is now under more heat and more pressure. streams of hot gas erupt into and fill the chest cavity or the large intestines which can really hurt. Its important that if you are getting this you need to change your diet because it can be really bad for you. If your stomach doesnt have anything to digest really then its bad because stomach acid keeps rougly three pounds of bacteria found in the colon from moving up into the small intestine. If this happens, bad bacteria and yeast can mingle in the intestine, resulting in less absorption of nutrients and inflamed intestines.  It gets worse (yes i really have been reading up on health risks for a long while now) I dont want to worry you but just.. its not too late. Apparently drinking lemon juice and warm water can help plus a stable healthy diet. Id go to the docs and consult them, they will know more about it than me. it COULD be what your explaining.. im not a doctor but it does sound a little like thats what might be happening and its a health riskbut it could just be something else. Its said a glass of milk does help too"

RE 300 kcalories: coincidentally your brain will use at least 300 Kcalories per day; Even if you lie down all day, you will still use about 1400 Kcalories per day (this is used to keep your heart beeting, & lungs breathing, your body warm etc. So if you eat under 1400 Kcalories per day the energy has to come from somewhere in your body & so you get very thin & your health deteriorates also: walking uses approx 350 Kcals per hour & running uses at least approx 900 Kcals per hour.  what did the doc tell u to do about your arrhythmia?"

It was a little while ago, when I was seeing someone (doctor/nurse/whatever) once a week for just a few months. He was a great help and I developed a bond with him, but one day he said something that made me want to put a chair through his face.  We were discussing things, and he said, ""...well at least you don't have an eating disorder to worry about"". Uh... did you even read my file? So I of course responded with ""Well no, actually I have bulimia.""  And then, his extra professional response?  ""Well you don't look bulimic.""  How the fuck did he work that one out? Are there no other fat bulimics in the world? I've been struggling with bulimia for over eight years. It's in my file. It's in my eroded teeth and thinned hair, scarred knuckles and bruised fists. It's that glazed over look when someone mentions food.  Anyway, it annoyed me. Has anyone else been told they ""don't look bulimic"" and did it annoy you just as much?"

I don't know how much of that food is junk or sweet stuff and chocolate but you are causing yourself a lot of harm eating that much.I speak as someone who has had a problem overeating and having my weight spiral upwards out of control myself.All I can do is tell you how I got it in control.Forget diets and charts nd plans, just go back to basics.Cook healthy meals from scratch, fresh fruit and veggiess ,get your five a day, meat or fish, cereals, toast or eggs for breakfast, yougurt with fresh fruit say rasperries for desserts and fruit on its owmn or with a bit of creame.Everything else like processed foods, crisps, cakes etc just don't buy it.If it is not in the house you can't eat it.If you can do this for yourself everytime you do a food shop you will soon get bck in control.I share your concerns and your gf's about moving in together and I think you need to get the healthy foods sorted and get your grocery bills down before you do move in together.Most of all I think you need to love yourself, there is no blame here, we all struggle with issues which cause our overeating and we need to be patient with ourselves and love ourselves into a healthy relationship with food.It is self hate makes us reach to food for comfort and to punish ourselves,we need to feel our emotions instead of stuffing them down and trying to avoid them with food.I hope you can do this, I know you can, If I could so can you.Best wishes.Nikitax"

I have BPD and a binge eating disorder. I binged for about six years before having treatment at an eating disorder clinic. I had cognitive analytical therapy and it helped me so much. I learned the reasons why I eat and how I got into the pattern of using food as a crutch. At first the therapy seemed a waste of time as it was making me eat more as I felt so bad remembering painful things but towards the end something clicked and I found I no longer had the strong urge to binge. I have had relapses but the treatment helped me so much. I just wanted to give you hope that you can over come binge eating disorder. I never thought I could but I have now managed to lose six stone. If you ever want to talk about this with me then you are most welcome to pm me.  It is wonderful you have a supportive relationship. Is it possible for your partner to maybe be in charge of the cooking? If she does the cooking then it is less stress and temptation for you. My partner is in charge of the cooking and it takes so much stress off me as I am hopeless at controlling portions.

As you have BPD, its possible that you are already preparing for the relationship to be a problem before its really got going - that is part of BPD, but remember, she loves you and wants you just as you are. Hold on to that love.  Have you ever heard of Dialectical Behavioural Therapy? Its really good for a lot of problems, but was originally created for people with BPD. Ask your GP if there is a course running near you. Its a year long and has a one to one session and one group session in a week. It really can help. I did a course and the techniques I learned still help me even though I am diagnosed with bipolar.  If not that, then ask for other therapy. Food is our primal link to love and affection, its the first thing we get along with a closeness to our mothers. If that relationship isn't strong enough, then it can lead to EDs. I'm not saying it is that, I don't know, its just an example as to how to look at food and how we relate to it.  Keep talking, the others here have more experience of this than me (but I am NOT exactly thin myself!)."

That is a very horrid way to feel and must make you feel upset. Making yourself sick is really dangerous and I am relieved to hear you have managed not to do it again. It sounds like you feel very sad inside and you are trying to control food as you are not in control of how you feel.

5916,Eating Disorders Forum,375660,what is wrong with me,2021-05-04T20:56:52+0100,author,True,101788,London,insectgirls,"Hi all, this is my first post here and I don't even know if I'll get any replies but I need to know what is wrong with me.  I'm currently 18, and I think I struggled with a binge eating disorder from when i started school in yr 7-11 because of stress and bullying at school. Then I moved schools in 2019 and binge ate often because moving was just so overwhelming for me, even though I had lots of new friends and was having a great time, so I became a little overweight and physically looked really chubby and bloated all the time. I've always been super self conscious about my body and weight and always thought people would like me more if I was just smaller and skinnier. In June 2020 I decided to lose weight so I started compulsively exercising everyday, and cut out all artificial sugars and some carbs like bread, pasta and rice and ate porridge for breakfast, salad for lunch and whatever mum makes for dinner. I also stopped binge eating by only eating three times a day at 7am, 12pm and 6pm. I did lose a lot of weight and now I'm bordering on underweight, (my body fat percentage is 20% apparently according to my scales) and I know this, but I still want to lose a little bit more, even though I haven't had my period since August 2020.  This makes me sound like I have a proper eating disorder but I don't have any proper fear foods really, I just avoid bread, milk, pasta and rice still. Also I really do think my relationship with food has improved since I stopped properly binge eating. A really weird symptom of this is that I have no hunger urges anymore. At all. I don't feel hungry. I've experimented on myself and I can just not eat for a whole day without feeling any different really. However, since April, because I recently turned 18, I fell into the trap of over-drinking, and over-eating with my friends. And, because it seems my body can recover well from over eating (ie I feel fine 3 hours later and look the same the next day) I've started binging again just out of curiosity? Just to see how my body handles it. Just like, I keep eating and eating even though I know I'm full. The weird thing is I don't feel guilty - its really just morbid curiosity mentally, even though physically I feel awful because my stomach feels like it's abt to explode. Also I only 'binge' on fruits and veg, not carbs or sugars. Also, this is so gross but I'm constipated all the time and I found out that if I overeat I can make myself poop a lot, lol (sorry tmi).  I don't think I have an eating disorder like anorexia or orthorexia but God i think about food ALL THE TIME. I obsessively plan my meals and get frustrated when I have to eat something unexpected. Like today at school I thought it would be veggie pie but instead it was pasta and I was so... angry? Frustrated? Upset? Because I hadn't planned for that even though I was expecting pie since literally before the weekend.  My point is, I want a normal relationship with food. I don't want to think about food all the time. I want to be healthy and I want to be normal. I don't want to overeat anymore. But I feel like I can't stop myself. Also I just feel so proud of myself when I go to bed thinking I underate, or that I finished a meal thinking I could eat more but didn't. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME. I don't WANT to have an eating disorder either, I've read all sorts of horrible things online about how it can mess with your body and end up killing you. I just, I'm so confused, I'm so scared. And despite all this, I don't want to gain weight but I don't want to be underweight and die.  TLDR: I don't get hungry anymore, and I still don't snack so I just eat at my set times and that's it. But I have started to consciously binge/overeat just out of curiosity to see what it makes me feel or to make me poop lol. This isn't normal is it? Also, just in case anyone asks, mentally I'm fine in every way apart from this weird eating thing. I'm not depressed, I'm not an insomniac or lethargic or whatever. I work out 4-6 times a week and walk 11k steps to and from school every week day and have a higher-than-average muscle percentage (according to my scales again). So like, I look healthy from the outside and feel fine in my head.  Finally, I go to uni in October and I'm just so terrified of what it will do to my eating. I feel like it's really possible that I'll either just forget to eat completely or overeat all the time. I don't know what to do. Sorry this is so long. Someone tell me what to do please. Sorry this is such a mess."

What you are involved with is a dangerous medical condition that can spiral fast. The kind of withholding of food that you are doing seems a lot like anorexia and this is an illness that people die from. If your doctor wants you to be at a normal weight that would probably be healthy. Does your Mom really have to go into the doctors office with you? That seems very invasive of your space and privacy. Couldn’t you ask her to have sometime with the doctor on your own? xo, j"

It is an illness that requires support. The sooner you are able to get the support you need the more likely it is that the illness will be kept under control and will not spiral. Of course ultimately what you decide to do is up to you. But by choosing not to go to the doctor about it you are preferring to stay sick and to take the risks that come with it. I would hope wellness for you and hope that you do whatever it is that you think will get you there. xo, j"

I have exams at the end of the month so I’ll stick it out until I’m done with school i think. it’s truly so weird because i think about food all the time but my aversion/restriction/bingeing of food comes in like waves or cycles? so i’ve eaten fine today. unfortunately this is unpredictable as hell so i’m stupidly nervous about what tomorrow will be like. otherwise thank you for your help"

I am so shocked and devastated that this has happened. I never thought it would. I guess after starving your body for so many months you just don't have the upper hand anymore when it comes to what and how much you eat. You become completely taken over by cravings, my poor deprived body fighting for nutrition and for normality to be restored.  I've completely lost touch of that concept - normality. Everything is too much or too little. I don't think i'll get out of this alone. I've gained weight for the first time in years and years and im scared to death. As soon as i finish a binge, along come the urges to starve and starve and starve myself to nothing.  I've never hated myself so much...i feel so utterly powerless.  I suppose I need support from someone who isn't acting out of fear! I need understanding!"

I know how terrible it feels when you slip from restricting, to bingeing and purging..for me, it feels like when i have been restricting, i feel in control,a nd happy with myself, but when i start to go through bingeing and purging cycles, it screams of a lack of control, and i can no longer deny that i have a problem...do you feel the same(or is it just me, lol)??

Yea i agree, it's definitely the lack of control that feels so awful. And i see what you mean about not being able to deny there's a problem. Its pretty obvious to everyone that i'm behaving abnormally when im holing myself up in the kitchen eating endless strings of peanut butter sandwiches at breakneck speed. And there's that shame that follows you around like everyone can see right into your head and they know how much youve eaten and how disgusting you feel. But of course noone ever talks about it.  I am seeing a counsellor. I haven't really spoken to him in depth about my eating issues..I started seeing him about depression because i was fed up of waiting for my medication to kick in and sort me out (it never did, just made me feel worse) i've only had a few sessions but im sure i'll be talking about the food stuff properly soon. again, the shame, i dont ever want to talk about it because i feel so despicable. But i dont want to be either starving myself or completely losing control, you know? I wish i settle happily in the middle somewhere."

I find that i can write things down much easier, and can actually articulate my thoughts quite well when i put pen to paper, might that be an easier option for you to? When i have had a binge and purge, i too feel like everyone can automatically see what i have eaten, and how crap i feel about myself, sometimes i feel like i have a massive neon sign over my head, flashing up ""eating disordered freak coming through..make room!!"". I guess i want to settle somewhere in the middle too, the same as you. I asked my counsellor this morning if it is possible to have recovery, but still lose weight...and she said that when you are in recovery, you no longer feel the need to lose weight (so those who are underweight/normal weight, they will put a bit on/stay the same), and my 1st thought was ""i cant EVER imagine being able to look in the mirror and think i look ok""..but i am hanging on in there, in the hope that it will happen once i reach recovery. What medication are you on, and how long did you take it for? I tried 3 types of AD's before i found one that suited me..and it took about 8 weeks for them to make a noticeable difference, but now i am not on them anymore, as there was no point (i was purging all the time, and they never stayed in my stomach long enough to get into my blood stream).Maybe you need to try a different type of AD's?"

I do find it much easier to write, i've always been a writer at heart and it comes a lot easier that way. only thing is i find myself judging what ive written and accusing myself of exaggerating or making things up/being over dramatic so sometimes it does a little more harm than good. I do however always find drawing helps me most to accurately express what im feeling, especially if what im feeling is violent self disgust...I draw pictures of myself and scribble all over them. i mean, how else do you fully express an intense desire to separate from your body and just become a floating brain with none of that awful flesh flapping around...  Yep i too have that feeling of really am i ever going to feel happy with myself again...I think its definitely something that comes with practice, and even for those ""normal"" people out there..Im sure everyone has to tell themselves they are fine the way they are even when they feel disgusting, just for us lot its a lot more of an uphill struggle with gravity relentlessly dragging us back down into pits of self-abuse.  Oh yea forgot to say: I was on sertraline for 4 months. Started at 50mg daily and upped to 100, then 150mg. I actually believe that it augmented a lot of my self-image problems and the fact that it took away my appetite for the first few weeks almost kick started a habit of not eating...I'm pretty sure that once it's out of my system i'll feel more in control of that. But maybe not, i dont know. I'm very very reluctant to try anything else. I'd rather just see what i can manage without drugs for a while seeing as i have counselling to help me along a little now. Definitely the counselling has helped a trillion times more than the medication ever did and it's only been a couple of weeks..!"

Wow- thats great that you feel the counselling is helping you more than the ADs..counselling can be a great support cant it. I know exactly what you mean about writing..when i was a kid, i used to write stories and poems, but as i have gotten older i dont have the time with 2 kids, so now i write in my diary everyday..i just cannot go a day without reading and writing something..i think thats why i find it so useful during counselling, as i can write things that i would never dream of saying! and i also understand what you mean in regards to thinking that you have exaggerated when you read what you have written..but you are not exaggerating anything, you are writing down your thoughts and feelings that you have right at that moment in time. Do you take your writing into counselling with you, so that you can show your counsellor? That way she knows whats going on, and makes it much easier to talk. the onlt thing that i find, is that when she reads it out to me, i feel soooo embarassed!! But she always asks me first, if i mind her reading it out..i always say she can, as writing it down is all very well, but i have a need to actually SAY verbally, what my thoughts are. I almost feel that if i cant actually verbalise how i am feeling, then i am not going to recover.  Oops, sorry, went on a bit then!!  Is your counsellor/GP aware that you are off your medication?

I've battled with depression since my early teens but food was never a part of it - or so I thought. I've been going through a really bad time - got made redundant a few weeks ago and my bingeing has just gone out of control - and I've realised that I've always had an issue with food - either not eating enough or eating too much. I'd never say I was anorexic and I'm a failure at being bulimic it would seem! It has had a knock on effect on my weight - I never have any clothes that fit as I get rid of all the big clothes when I am thin and vice versa and I will never look good naked as I have horrible stretch marks on my thighs. I'm not on AD's at the mo, I don't really want to be, and I don't have a counsellor. Maybe I should but I feel, oddly enough, if I resort to both of those things, I will have even less control over my life. I guess I want to beat this on my own. But as it's already been said, the right weight and ""getting over an ED"" never really happens. And that thought in itself is probably the most depressing of all.  Sorry, I seem to have rambled on here about nothing, a symptom of being on my own all day every day I guess! But does anyone else wonder how they will ever get through this or if it will ever actually end? It's harder to give up binging than it is smoking!  xx"

I've never been a smoker but you know it so wouldnt surprise me.  Also, this may sound kind of wierd but I hope you get to accept and love your body with all its imperfections. Now, i far from like my body right now, in my eyes it is truly grotesque, but i've noticed as soon as i stop punishing myself and telling myself im a failure etc, i start liking what i see in the mirror. Of course it is easier said than done, which is partly why im still locked in the whole starve/binge/purge cycle at the moment.  An old ex-girlfriend of mine had stretch marks all over her body and everytime i saw them i felt compelled to draw/photograph them, i thought they looked beautiful on her, almost as if they were decorations (this is also how i try to see my self-harm scars.). Of course, she never saw it that way, but ""looking good naked"" is not a question of eradicating everything you don't like about yourself & much, much more about saying ""look at me, i feel gorgeous!"" no matter what you look like because self-confidence really, really shows. There are bits about everyone that they hate, even the most ""perfect"" looking model (and to be honest they are nothing to go by because they all struggle with self-hatred and eds anyway) will look rubbish in anything they wear if they dont consciously assert this air of confidence and ""fuck you, im beautiful"".  stay strong."

For me this was quite a jump because I was vehemently against diets and the like because my sister suffers from an eating disorder, and it affected our family very badly. So I ate what I want and violently rejected anything to do with dieting or working out, because of associating it with my sister and her illness. However, as I got into my mid 20s my metabolism slowed down and I gained weight. Quite a bit of weight. I started feeling bad about my body, and since I had developed very poor eating habits over the years, it was very hard for me to get going and lose that weight. The use of the app and gym is for various reasons: It makes me feel healthier, therefore better about myself. I am losing the weight and liking my body more. And of course, the control issue. I never understood my sister's need to ""control"" her food until now. I don't think I have an eating disorder, but there is a fine line between control and obsession. If you are hating your body and counting every thing that passes your lips, then you must get the issue addressed. I don't believe that counting calories and exercising is wrong; for many people it is necessary. So let a professional help you seperate the obsession from the activity, and find a way for you to get healthier without being paranoid about everything you eat and drink. Also, weighing yourself every day is a sure fire way to invite frustration! Good luck and I hope things improve for you."

Share your story.,2020-04-16T16:33:28+0100,author,True,89760,London,emmaleemochizuki,"I always had disordered eating but I was about 15 when it spiralled into a full blown eating disorder. It was a number of things that triggered it. I was starting to go through puberty and I was very uncomfortable with how my body was changing. I lost someone very important to suicide, and there's a lot of conflicting emotions about that. At the same time I was doing my GCSEs and stressing about exams, and my scholarship on hold. And there was a lot of other things too and all of that became a perfect 'recipe', and I was diagnosed with anorexia.  I'm almost 21 now, and it has been a long journey. As time goes on I realised that it was far more than just food and weight. In fact probably nothing really about that. I experienced a lot trauma when I was young and developed a lot of maladaptive coping mechanisms where eating disorder was one of them. The last six years was a lot of ups and downs. I have been sectioned, admitted multiple times to EDUs and acute wards. But slowly I am recovering. I am still very far from recovered and I know I might not ever get there, but working with my therapist, my psychiatrist, my CPN and everyone that was involved in my care, challenging what I fear the most, things have changed, and I have grown.  What is your story?"

My parents got home and blamed the babysitter. And so my trend of secret overeating/bingeing began. Only as opportunity presented itself which was not too often. Now I only overeat substantially when I am in manía from my bipolar. But there is really no “solution” but rather an ongoing struggle of which yo-yo dieting seems to be key.

Although I didn't engage in any ""behaviors"", I would always try and eat the smallest slice of cake, etc. Then it went more into binging, and I would constantly think about my body in a negative way. I have always had a passion for swimming, so I would always think about how many hours I would do in a week and always train at every training. But I would say that my real anorexia started when lockdown was it in place. I lost weight very rapidly, and ended up in the hospital in the end of November where I stayed for 12 weeks.

I got out of control with my anxiety really badly and was shaking and the police though I was on something so they called me an ambulance so I ended up in in the Emergency room because my heart rate was fast and then they send me home saying that there is nothing wrong with me.

It sounds like, to me anyways, what you're experience is indicative of being a Hypochondriac. According to centerforanxietydisorders.com , "" Hypochondria is a mental health disorder. It usually starts in early adulthood and may show up after the person or someone they know has gone through an illness or after they've lost someone to a serious medical condition."" Which heavily reminds me of what you described.  I used to suffer from something very similar, a little over a decade ago. So I doubt it was actual Hypochondria, but I was learning in Science class about diseases, and from there the spiral began. What I have learned from that experience is this: looking up symptoms, as suuuuuper tempting as I know it is, will only end in disaster. I know it's much, much easier said than done, but if at all possible try to avoid looking it up. Maybe leave it to your Doctor if you're exceptionally concerned. I did this, and every single time it ended up being actually nothing, save for once that I had a cold. lol  I hope this helps!!"

Im glad you have eaten. Not surprised it feels overwhelming some days. The Fitbit makes sense re. heart but are you sure it’s helping you? Sounds like it’s driving the anxiety up rather than helping. You know it’s ventricular ectopics and your ear. Your heart is going to be ok. No point watching your heart rate all day. When I do that it always goes up and that defeats the purpose. Have they advised when your appetite will come back after coming off the clopidogrel?   Ears / dizziness - I can relate. Long time inner ear problem (dizziness, nausea, low energy). It grinds you down.  To help manage moderate anxiety I use audiobooks + a visual activity (painting, cleaning, puzzles, gardening) to keep my brain busy. Do you do this? It works to give your brain a little holiday. A favour author being read to you can be very comforting.  Im sorry you are going through this. Im sending a virtual hug Jolly x"

Not only about sicknesses, about everything. I worry about big and small, from my husband getting in a car crash or a tree falling on our house, to the mower breaking down or not being able to cook supper, etc etc etc. I worry that my medicines make me sick, but I’m too worried that quitting them will make me feel worse to try. It’s endless. I also have automatic negative thoughts, I go on and on about things I did wrong in my life and what I should have done instead. I wonder if it’s some the same thing?  It is so time consuming, a total waste I agree.  I have never talked to anyone that feel like I do before I came to this forum. But I know there are a lot out there just like us!

Not sure I told you but hubby works at a hospital and I am lucky he can work from home (he hates it). I dread the day he goes back. So sad you had to leave your teaching job. Could you not go back part time to see how you cope. I have just taken a tablet as I am not strong enough to fight it like you xx Click to expand... I miss the kids being little. I thank God I wasn’t sick then. I’m not coping very well right now. My anxiety is at its peak. I don’t feel strong enough to fight it so tablet it is. I was the same hubby was working from home for months but he had to go back work. Its hard adjust to him not around. Hubby will be coming home soon. I hope I won’t be crying when he gets here.

I’ve read many articles that say the best way to stop it in its tracks is to welcome it, not run away etc, and I feel I’m getting to the point where I’m willing to give it a go, but it would help me hugely if I knew others had the same symptoms.  when I have an ‘attack’ it’s generally associated with getting out of breath (in the gym, running) and can also just come on if I’m anticipating a long period of ‘isolation’ like a long journey on my own in the car. I basically feel I can’t catch my breath/take a deep enough breath, then I will try again, and if I can’t I feel the need to swallow for some reason. Inevitably, I then struggle to compete a swallow and it makes me sh1t myself (not literally), and I’ll retreat to a safe place, where it gets better, with maybe a yawn to help me get a good breath and some water to help me swallow.I don’t get the racing pulse, the tingling, but I do worry I’m going to choke.  sorry for rambling, but I think it will help me to hear of anyone else who gets it the same way!"

It’s obviously down to my anxiety disorder and wondered if there are any useful ( no matter how silly they sound ) tips on how to change this? Another problem is speaking with females who look interested in me romantically ( giving me the eye ) I seem to turn away and do my best to not engage in eye contact and body language let alone talk to them even if I really want to. I think it is a mixture of confidence and my disorder although before getting really ill I used to DJ to audiences of 300 + people and even then I found I had these problems slightly. I could not start a conversation yet I could participate in one. Nerves and a lot of negative thinking flood my thoughts so quickly yet someone talks to me I do not have time to think of all negatives but I do some.

When I was in my early 20s, I was TERRIFIED of talking to girls. I got some interest, but I just froze up at the thought of making a move. The anxiety was so bad I would often vomit. For me, repeated exposure was key. Possibly the best thing that ever happened to me was facing one of my worst nightmares: going in to kiss a girl and having her reject me. It actually wasn't as bad as I feared it would be. After that, I really wasn't scared anymore. I bet the issue here is, like with me, completely in your head. I can relate also to having trouble starting conversations. Now it is a no-brainer, but it was so hard for a while because I was terrified of looking stupid or being rejected. You can do it - it can and will get easier with time. The key is putting yourself out there repeatedly and not being too hard on yourself in the process. It takes time. Best wishes!"

I have always been like this. The most devastating thing is seeing everyone else having a good time, knowing that I'm missing out. I panic because I think of what could happen, the times I was so close yet so far, and the women that were disgusted by my presence. It's not often when a female has been interested, but when they have it's the intense types. Having their full attention and smiles, it is overwhelming. I fear that I won't ever get a chance. That's part of the problem, like walking a tight rope, it's easy to fail. The anxiety is because I can never get over the line, it's like making a deal in business, I don't have the nerves to negotiate a date, or make small talk. I see the lady from like across a room or in a waiting line, waiting room, passing in the street, and I just walk on by or avoid them and pretend ""oh, they can't possibly like me, they must be checking out someone else"", ""I'm not good enough for them"" etc.  The interest i received was very rare (when I was teens to 20s), and I'm several years older now in my mid 30s. Still as worried as ever."

I too find romantic rejection painful. I very rarely get any attention, or not that I notice at all.  I like to think I'm good at flirting and banter with females but maybe I'm not otherwise I wouldn't be single. I've had relationships and girlfriends before.  First GF I asked her out drunk I had Dutch courage and was outrageously forward, not a chance I'd have done it sober.  The second gf/relationship I had she pursued me, I basically talked to her one time, took an interest in her accent once. Sort of just treated her as normal, and it culminated in her pursuing me.  I don't think I've experienced the eye as people have mentioned here. I usually avoid eye contact with girls. I did once have a crush on a girl and couldn't stop looking at her, that was probs worse than having to avert my gaze as you could just tell she wasn't interested at the time I took her coyness and evasive behaviour as interest, in actual fact, it was her way of telling me thanks but no thanks. 8 even wrote her a love letter lol which got read out in front of the whole class. Sooo embarrassing. Man she was cruel to me, beyond the usual rejection.  I think the thing that keeps my anxiety going is fear of the unknown and also I tend to think nobody is interested in me. So why bother? I seem to have built up a very defeatist attitude over the years from multiple rejections; which of course probably projects in my behaviour, I wonder if this applies to people here? It could also be the anxiety shows on the face too.  I don't have any solutions sadly as rejection and associated anxiety and depression is something I currently struggle with. I think it's linked to self worth too and esteem so building those would help anyone who is interested in getting better in this area. But it's an ongoing journey and I'm no expert."

Female friendship and have eventually met them and had a good time as friends. I was so terrified at first even on my meds that work for me. I overthink all the time but tried hard not to and managed to engage in conversation through text mainly.  I am worried as I will have to come off my meds due to a health problem and try to think it’s not the meds it’s me that’s doing this ..  Best advice is go in looking for friendship your be surprised I mean I get the impression some of these females want more as I not trying to chase them and rather being genuine about what i want.  The first step is the hardest bout in space of 2/3 weeks my confidence has shot up and it’s true You have to just go for it. Try the message approach first as I found that easier than approaching someone in the street. I hope this helps I was in the same boat as you and wish you well in your recovery.

You don't have to start the conversation. It's your choice. The fact that you are able to participate is the key here."

I agree with you, exercise is the best natural therapy of all. It's just ashame the effects only last a couple of hours afterwards, I then feel the need for that natural mellow effect again, it can become quite addictive. It works so well for me, I try and get down the gym everyday now.  Like NrLondonguy, I too am looking for a combination of natural therapies; exercise being one, aromatherapy oils, I'm going to sign up for a yoga class soon, Accupuncture, vitamins and more.  I haven't tried St Johns Wart NrLondonGuy, because it will counteract with the pill in which i'm taking.  But it's all worth a go.  I hope it works for you."

When I started exercising about a month ago using exercise DVDs (and I started with a very easy low-impact one) I was exercising every day. I felt pleased that I was doing something but it didn't really improve my mood, and I would sit around for an hour or two after as I felt totally exhausted. Anyway about 2 weeks in I got to the stage where I could barely walk, my legs and knees were hurting so much, joint pain rather than muscle pain, so I eased off a bit to give myself a rest. Then I would find myself crying while I was exercising because I felt so useless. In the end I gave up but I feel a total failure.  I know I should try something like walking, but I don't like going out much any more, certainly not on my own which I am most of the time during the day."

My girlfriend suffers with Anxiety pretty badly about all sorts of things. She goes through phases of seeming better/worse and new things that she's anxious about seem to pop up every so often which she really struggles with.  She's had CBT before but said it didn't help, although externally she did seem to get better but that may have just been the anxiety going away of it's own accord. She seems to be really struggling at the moment and I don't really know how I can help. I am always up for talking stuff out but I don't know what the right or wrong thing to suggest is and I don't want to make her feel worse ever.  I've tried to suggest she goes back to the doctor and asks for more CBT or something similar but she says it's a waste of time and won't help.  My question is, what should I suggest she does? I don't want to push her to do something she doesn't want to do but I also don't want her to feel bad so maybe convincing her to go get CBT might be most beneficial in the long run?  She's amazing and I really, really hate seeing her struggling and want to help but just don't know how so any suggestions would be massively appreciated."

It's really amazing too see you trying to help your girlfriend, that alone will go a long way to helping her.  I found it hard to confide in my partner when I was severely depressed and suffered severely with anxiety, I was concerned that, despite me knowing she would be there and support me, there was a slight chance she would find it too much and leave.  She might not be ready to talk about anything yet because she doesn't know what too talk about. If you can re-assure her that you'll be there for her, don't try and force her to talk about her problems, but suggest it. If she says no, suggest she talks to a friend or family.  Aside from being there to support her and help her work through her rough days, giving her space when she needs it is just as important.

Some work better than others for individual people. I'm guessing she hasn't probably done a full 6 month course of CBT with a therpist before 'giving up'? there are also medications that can help ranging in the spectrum from herbals to prescriptions. I take st. john's wart 900 mg a day, (takes a few months to start being effective as does any SSRI). This helps me feel stable enough to work on CBT methods... you have to get to a point where you are stable enough to be able to feel OK first and sometimes that may need some medication. Other herbals are SAM-E, GABA. You can also just start with B vitamin complex which gives some help.  prescription stuff -- any SSRI can help with generalized anxiety disorder.   Regarding CBT: It is really 90%+ effective. so I'd find it hard to believe it would 'fail' on her. Its likely she just isn't quite ready or persistent enough for it and needs to feel a little better first. Usually you start with breathing technique -- breathing, exercise, meditation and visualization, thought countering , self confidence, emotional exercises, nutrition, medical analysis... again has she given each of these a fair shake? My recommendation is always 'the anxiety and phobia workbook' by edmund bourne which details these sections. Its no substitute for a therapist but its a cheap book you can buy so you yourself can real about anxiety disorders and understand them better and may be able to better guide her from it."

Then still in September she had a total mental break down,i walked into our backroom and found her lying on the floor,on which she let out a terrible scream,she was in a psychotic state of mind,she started hitting me,then grabbed a sharp utensil from the kitchen,i grabbed it and it snapped in my hand. Long story short,she got detained under a section 2,and was in hospital for approx 2 months,she got released,i didn't think she was 100% well,and i was right.  She got taken into hospital again in June 2020 but they released her after a very short time,which i was not happy about. And she's been at home to the present day,they diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder,but i believe she has gone into a psychotic depression,she is totally vulnerable,she barely eats and has lost a lot of weight,she just paces around her bedroom all day and she has extreme paranoia like people are out to harm her,and food water and her medication are poison.  I am not a trained mental health person and i am stressed all the time,and i believe she needs to be sectioned again,but the mental health team she is under are not helping at all.  Regards Stephen"

I have been having hot baths, gym and meditaitn and lorazepam to relax me but still bloody anxious. Anyway in desperation today and to avoid going back on weight inducing medication I tried accupuncture and accupressure at my local chinese medicine shop. I have to say it really did help and this eveing I feel the most chilled I have for weeks (still a bit edgy though). I went in sceptical and all over the place and when I came out I seriously just wanted to lye down in teh shopping centre and go to sleep. (that nice feelign lasted about 30mins but am much more relaxed and calmer this evening.  Anyway it really helped me so Ihave signed up for a 10 session treatment thing. They said that the accupuncture opens the body and tehn the accupressure relaxes it (and your mind) or something. They said in my state I shoudl start with 3 sessions a week, then 2 then 1 and in teh end you can stop altogether or just have 1 session every month and a half to keep it up and that it has long term benefits. Honestly, I was really sceptical and just one session has made a massive differnce.  Like with all things best to get someone who knows what they are doing and yoru local chinese medicaine shop shouls have someone. (every town has one). My nurse said some of his other patients do it also and it really helps them too. Just thought I woudl throw this out there."

Best think ot try is accupunctuer AND accupressure. Accupuncture opens the body whatever that means and accupressure does what ever that does. DOn't know much about it but put it this way. 3 weeks ago I was all over place, couldn't keep still concnetrate and now after 3 weeks of it I am MUCH mroe relaxed and now confident I may even be able to avoid SSRI. (which I havn;t tried). It really has helped. Accupressure particulry- thats like a specific massage. I feel so relaxed and lovely evertime I go out. Shame its so expensive : (  Its costs £55 a session. They said for it to be affective as with any therpay you shodu ldo a whole ocurse fo it so I paid for 10 sessions and get 3 free. It is helping though., Still anxious but MUCH less. (I mean 3 weeks ago I thought only solution woudl be to go on an SSRI drug).  Talk to them as maybe even once a wekk coudl be better then nothing.  Also I am seeing some guy in London soon and he does accupucnture and uses this thing called a tens machine. He attaches it to your feet and legs and it completely calsm you down no sideffects. A woman I know told me about that. She had a friend who had schizonphrenia and was totally manic after hospitla and nothing coudl calm him down, drugs didn't work nothing. He went to this accupuncurist and he gave him the machien told him how to use it and it totally sedates him - no side effect. Machine costs £25 and furtehr £25 for guy to show you how it works. I will give a try and let you know.  I suffer from bad anxiety and anything that calms you down can't be bad expcially if no sideffects.  Woudl advice you also talk to you GP for any NHS treatment that can help"

So feel positive that you are already doing something very good, that isn't easy mentally or physically. It sounds not too uncommon how you are feeling. I would suggest you be a little more 'selfish' when visiting. Go there with some distraction plans. Go to some of your favourite spots, plan it before you go or when you are there and either go with your family or on your own if that's an option. I would visit family abroad and I wouldn't know anyone really apart from my grandparents, but I found bringing my lap top and watching a whole box set really helped brake up the trip and was great when I was on my own relaxing. Maybe if that's not for you go for a long walk with some music, take some photographs, read a book, download and play some games on your phone, tablet or lap top. When you spend time with them do it with something you enjoy, maybe just be with them when its time to eat. I think basically find a positive distraction and it will help relax you, and have more fun while you are over there, good luck and enjoy your time away!"

I go back every couple of years and they have come over about three times. I went home this Christmas for the first holiday with them in years - albeit brief, because the airfares are so crazy expensive at this time, and I could only get certain dates. Less than two weeks! It was high summer there and while normally I feel anxiety about tie with family, not being used to it, this time I got over my anxieties and really enjoyed the experience. However, since I left a few days ago, I've been seriously homesick. From the moment my Dad dropped me off at the airport to now, I keep having meltdowns. Sobbing, wailing, forming attachment to things related to my visit; even not washing clothes I wore when I was there. I know it's attachment anxiety at play but not sure how to deal with it. I Skyped my folks tonight to see if that helped but seeing the sun shining and my parents just kicking about (they are off work for a couple more weeks) on their own made it even worse. My mum admitted how much she would have loved to have me there even one more week, although she knows how much more expensive it was and wouldn't have wanted me to pay that even if I could. It's just so hard to be limited by airfares. Anyway. If anyone has any remedies for attachment anxiety and homesickness, then I would be super grateful. I feel sick to my stomach not knowing when I'll see my folks again, and even telling myself I'll save up to see them in six months still makes me want to cry... Because it's not now.

My mum is my one surviving parent,I am not the one to follow as my example is a bad one.I live in the same town as my mum and still ring her a couple of times as day.I am attached to her and it does get ridiculous how much I feel safer and more connected and emotionally secure when I maintain contact and communications with her regularly.  The important thing though is I can disconnect and not have contact for months and still feel secure and confident and emotionally strong without that contact.....though it has been a while since that has been put fully to the test.  i think reassure yourself that your parents aren't going anywhere and are at the end of the phone,available through letter writing, skype etc and will always be there next time you want to visit.You know they love you and will be there for you if you need them,there is no need to be anxious separated from them as you carry them or a part of them inside you and biologically you share their make up DNA.This makes me feel better about separation,it is tough because I suffered neglect as a child,was left alone often as a 5 year old, walked myself to school and came home to the doorstep waiting outside till mum came home from work to let me in,so the roots of separation anxiety were laid long ago for me.  Maybe explore your own history and see what insights you may find to help you with what you are going through today in terms of attachment anxieties.There must be I am sure lots written about this too.Nikitax"

Since I was a kid, I was a high-achiever and people expected a lot from me. My passions were writing and drawing but the pressure kind of got to me, and in a way, the pressure kind of takes away the pleasure of doing things just for yourself and no one else. I also did well academically and one day, at around the age of 11, I got it in my head that I had to keep out-doing myself that I had to be the very best all the time. Soon there no longer were any limits in my mind.  At age 13 I read and learned as much as I could, because I wanted to be prodigious. I became my own worst enemy and remember going to bed drained. At 14 I think I cracked and my mind went funny and my concentration went down the drain. I was tested for ADD, but in the end it was obvious I didn't have it, it was probably just mental exhaustion etc.  But this drive to reach the stars and manically be the best stuck with me, I raised the bar high and went crazy with goals and ambitions I set for myself, I raised the bar so high and felt frustrated and angry that I couldn't reach them, which was irrational because they were so far-fetched and ambitious that they were almost impossible to reach, and even to attain them would mean extremely hard work, which I didn't have the energy or patience for, or even the organization. It was so contradictory. I didn't want to work for it and expected it all to just come to me. Maybe due to being spoiled. I also didn't even know HOW to get started with all that craziness and targets. It's like part of me kept nagging me to get on with it, and the other part refused and didn't want to. I think I imagined that I had more energy than I actually physically had.  I've looked back at all the lists I wrote for myself back then, lists of all these highly ambitious, over the top goals and plans. They stun me, because they are almost unrealistic! I'm not surprised I didn't get most of them done! Part of me just wants to get rid of them to take the past stress away. But then part of me kind of wants to keep them so that in the future I can see how manic I was? I've done some of those things I set myself, the ones I thought were worth it anyway, like publish poems, start writing a book, send written works to newspapers etc. I think some of the ideas I set down were just excuses to burn off energy, which I have A LOT of. I think it's all about energy, really.  Some things I set on the list I think were just attention-seeking things and trivial, of no real importance. I wouldn't do them now because it just seems silly. I think everyone wants to make a mark, accomplish great things in a way, and when you're a teenager you don't always reason well or think straight, you just want the whole world. Well, I did anyway. I wanted to do everything and be everywhere because I didn't really focus on my passion. My grandiosity was probably trying to compensate for deep insecurities. I knew this but stubbornly carried on anyway. Half of me was sensible and wanted me to calm down, and the other half was caught up in it and wanted to act out these maniacal whims. Is that normal. It's like a crazy conflict within myself. What should I do about all the goals, and the high standards I set myself? I know about the link between raising the bar too high and self-destruction. Help!  Has anyone else been through this? And does anyone have any idea why I became like this and where it comes from? I've been struggling with this for so long that any help would be veryyyy much appreciated!! Thanks for reading..."
6120,Generalized Anxiety Disorder Forum,33686,Perfectionism and raising the bar so high,2011-12-31T12:33:41+0000,replier,False,16890,London UK,Quasimodo,"Hi there - I can definitely relate, and though my story is perhaps slightly different it shares the same main features.  I grew up in a school system where teaching was adjusted to accommodate everyone, particularly the stragglers. Hence some of us, myself included, never found it particularly challenging. I found that I could usually ace most classes without really making that much of an effort. When I struggled a lot socially, suffering a lot of bullying, this became my way of asserting myself, and I constantly wanted to show off how much I knew (which probably did not help the bullying part...)  Then came the shock - I left the safe confines of my local school system and joined university, where the bar was raised sharply, and where I could no longer just sail through. The frustration I experienced from this, where I could no longer achieve the perfection I was used to without significant effort, and even then it was not guaranteed, coupled with the deep set insecurity that came from 10 years of bullying, I struggled to cope.  At the same time my ambitions did not change, and I have achieved a lot. I have a position with one of the leading companies in my industry, and I have just been given a new job with the government which I think not few envy me but which is also one of the hardest jobs available within my field, and which will be very demanding from several angles.  And this is where my perfectionism terrifies me - how can I ever live up to these standards I have set for myself in this new job? The pressure I put on myself has already driven me to depression, anxiety disorders and heavy medication to handle my current job, and now I willingly go into an even harder job? Perfectionism is already making me resent and outright hate myself for failing to meet my impossible standards - how will I cope??"
