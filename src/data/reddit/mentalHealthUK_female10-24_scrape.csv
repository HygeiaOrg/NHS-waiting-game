0,mbjz4v,what can I [15F] say to CAMHS to convince them to at least let me try out medication?,I need advice/support,"hi all, I don't need resources to other mental health sites; I've contacted my GP (as in I literally just got off the phone from my GP) about potential anxiety and/or sleep medication

what she said was basically that because I'm 15, and underage, and in CAMHS, they can't prescribe my anything until CAMHS tells them that it's okay to send prescriptions to me. I asked her to at least talk to CAMHS about it and she didn't say anything about it so I'm taking that as a she won't talk to them (so what I have booked with my GP is a urine sample and a blood test to see if I have an infection and to see if there's literally anything wrong with me, hormones or whatever)

with my actual CAMHS worker, I honestly and I really do mean this when I say it, I really, really, have been been trying to get sleep medication from them. I've been in CAMHS for over two years and I'm still not getting it - I've been asking for ages and I've been trying to fix it too

I'm currently getting an ADHD diagnosis and now he's (my CAMHS worker) is using that as another reason to postpone prescribing sleep medication but everything I'm doing that is unrelated to medication isn't working

is there anything I can do/say to get myself medication?

please don't tell me not to want sleep medication this badly. it's been so hard sleeping 12-20 hours every other day and not being able to prevent it and it's been so difficult to wake up on time or at all. I'm immensely stressed about college because of how bad my sleep schedule is and how it has not improved within the whole entire time I've been in CAMHS for

should I just weight until if I get diagnosed with ADHD? I've heard there's stimulate medication for ADHD (or something along those lines)

my doctor mentioned how I'll probably have to wait until I'm ’16, no, 18’ to get any sort of mental health related medication",13,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/mbjz4v/what_can_i_15f_say_to_camhs_to_convince_them_to/,2021-03-23 17:31:20,15F
1,mm1u6q,Eating disorders & CAMHS -TW,I need advice/support,"Hi
First of all, apologies for my English - I haven't lived here very long
 
I am 15f and I have been struggling with restricting food intake since 2 years- however I’m still a “healthy weight” I’m having other health issues and after a scare with very low heart rate a few weeks ago I finally asked for help. However CAMHS say I am not high risk and therefore they won’t treat the Ed, choosing to treat my ocd instead. I understand that the ocd also needs treatment, but that is not why I sought help and actually the Ed is much harder to cope with. 
Now I feel very invalid (might not be the right word sorry) and it makes my Ed worse because I feel like I need to lose more weight just to be taken seriously
Is there anyway I can get them to help me? Or will I just have to keep going until they realise it’s a Problem

0,vtkyih,How can I get a full psychological exam as a teen?,I need advice/support,"**I'll preface this by letting you know a few things:** 

\- I created this account to post this anonymously, but I plan on continuing to use it as an alt for similar posts and comments in the future. This is my second account (IIRC). I thought I'd get that out there so you don't suspect me of being a bot or a troll or something lol.

\- I'm a lurker and I don't post a lot. Therefore, I'm not too savvy on reddit etiquette - please let me know I'm doing anything wrong.

\- I ramble a lot (as you can tell). I have ADHD and anxiety, and the combo means I go on tangents and write / say way too much. I'll make this post easier to navigate by making **important info bold** (though it is as concise as I can get it without leaving out crucial info), redrafting and paragraphing - please bare with me. sorry it's such a mess. 

\- Please also let me know if there are other subs I can post this on. Posting here because I dont know who else to ask. 

\- I have rational reasons to believe I have another disorder, as a have many symptoms which I know are abnormal because I am somewhat open about this with close friends who agree with me.

**TLDR:** Despite already being in CAMHS, I feel I have an undiagnosed mental illness which has been overlooked 

**The actual post:**

I, (16F, 17 in 17 days), **have been diagnosed with ADHD - and been with CAMHS - for most of my life,** been prescribed meds for this as well as being on and off **meds for anxiety and depression** \- though I'm not diagnosed formally - I'm diagnosed with ADHD with emotional dysregulation (Sp?) (formerly diagnosed with anxiety and depression being part of my ADHD diagnosis, which is probably more accurate). I've **had several different counsellors, and am currently with one** in school who is amazing but I have a very limited amount of sessions and she doesn't want to go too deeply into anything which is stopping me from discussing this.

**I have always felt very strongly that I have something going on beyond ADHD - i.e. other undiagnosed mental illness(es). I've made my psychiatrist aware of this** but CAMHS is very apprehensive to diagnose minors with more serious things. He dismisses me but I feel that he is very rushed and overloaded with work, and cannot look into every little feeling I have (he individually has this reputation). **Counsellors who I've discussed this with have agreed with me**, but have only suspected things once I explain my suspicion to them.

**This feeling has taken over my life**. I **obsessively research** all sorts of personality disorders and other illnesses, **I take dozens of online tests and quizzes despite knowing their unreliability (all of which have had concerning and consistent results)**, and I write lists of my symptoms, etc. My biggest fears are that I will convince myself so strongly that I have one of these illnesses, and eventually develop it / traits of it as a self fulfilling prophecy. I also fear that I will receive a diagnosis which will lead me to conform to it and amount to nothing due to the belief that I am unstable and sick. However, part of me feels this is more likely to happen if I do not get diagnosed.

Labels are a blessing and a curse. **I fear I will become my illness / imagined illness.**

I am too anxious to approach my parents about this - I'm willing to if I must, but other options would be preferable. All a GP would do would be to tell me to talk to my psychiatrist. Waiting until I'm an adult is feasible but Im afraid I will damage my mental health further before then and I'm really desperate because my life is falling apart thanks to this phantom / undiagnosed illness.

**I don't want a screening for anything specific** because I know that if I am not diagnosed, I will end up latching onto another mental illness, and if I am diagnosed, I may suspect misdiagnosis or additional illnesses. I'd rather be evaluated by someone with an open mind to all disorders rather than focusing on one.

**I'm not fishing for a diagnosis,** I truly believe there is something more at play and I feel that a diagnosis would help me understand myself more and stop me from falling further down this hole. It would also help me find more personalised advice and help online and in therapy. 

**Thank you so much for reading this. It means a lot. If you need any additional info, please PM or comment and I'll respond as quickly as possible.**

I plan on maybe posting this in some other subs in the case that it doesn't get much attention. I'll try not to spam subs but I'm really desperate for a solution.",4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/vtkyih/how_can_i_get_a_full_psychological_exam_as_a_teen/,2022-07-07 15:14:05,16F

1,u2alni,"Hi, anyone please, what options do I have?",I need advice/support,"I'm 17F, I was diagnosed with general anxiety and derealisation when I was 13/14, but these problems started when I was 10. When I was 14 i finally started receiving cognitive behavioural therapy. It didn't last long and it was barely helpful at all as my therapist hadn't even heard of derealisation/depersonalisation disorder. It ended right before the pandemic hit. They knew that I was on-and-off suicidal and my mother was heavily involved with it which is why I had to withhold information.

Fast forward 2 years and my problems are worse than ever. I went back to the doctor's for this reason who referred me to counselling. Long story short it was not very helpful either because it was just repeating things I'd heard already which I already put in practice. Furthermore it was over the phone, and I live with my family so I can't talk about certain topics either while at home.

And of course I was still struggling, so I went back to the doctors and they said they would refer me somewhere else. Now that was months ago, like 6. And I can't wait any longer. I even went through my college safeguarding team to get another referral but didn't hear anything since which was also 2 months ago. 
I'm on-and-off suicidal and they know this, I have a really big problem with heavy mood swings, I'm scared something will push me over the edge because I don't have any support at all, I've tried online websites support lines and phone ones and ones over text.

But this year has been hard on us all, and I've realised some hard truths about myself: I get super anxious in social situations. I get socially exhausted so easily, unless the people I'm with are my best friends/boyfriend. Today (Christmas Day) brought up a lot of difficult emotions for me: I felt invisible but also felt anxious about what I would say when someone spoke to me. 

I've also long suspected I'm somewhere on the autistic spectrum, although I've been to my GP to talk about seeing a specialist and they've always refused as I don't show any of the obvious signs, but I've also read that girls have a harder time getting diagnosed. I also read an article on some of the common signs of ADHD and some of them resonated with me: either way I need some explanation as to who I am and how I can move forward. My mental health is declining and I need to do something about it.

What I'm asking here is: who can I talk to? What is available to me? How could I get a diagnosis or just some kind of analysis?

1,qtrfam,Can my GP diagnose me with GAD,I need advice/support,"Posted from ask a doctor subreddit

Hi, I'm 18F and live in the UK, so let me know if this is the wrong sub for this.

I've struggled with anxiety for a long time, like since I was about 12 and although it's been recognised by multiple mental health specialists and CAHMS (Went for an autism assessment and the reports mostly discuss that they believe I have anxiety) and I spoke to my GP earlier this year, who prescribed me 50mg sertraline ever day, which had helped significantly. However I'm pretty sure that this doesn't count as a diagnosis, which means my university can't give me any support or special considerations or whatever, which I find myself in need of (My high school would just provide those things without a diagnosis, and even then I plummeted, as many did, mentally during the 3rd UK lockdown, so I wasn't as in need back then.)

So even though I've put this through google a few times it never gives me a straight answer. I want a diagnosis - can I ask my GP for that or do I have to go through the torment that is self-referral/waiting for a referral/CAHMS etc? I was given a blood test that came back as saying that I was anaemic but otherwise healthy, which I know can be a part of the process sometimes?

I was diagnosed with BPD (this was in March 2021), I was recommended medication for my mood swings and DBT, which is really expensive and I really can't afford it. My GP said it wasn't her job to help and that I was overwhelming her, which made it really difficult to trust her afterwards and now I'm always anxious to talk to her. 

After the private psychiatrist started pressing the matter, my GP agreed to put me in therapy. Now, this therapy isn't helping me much because it's for depression, and I tried to talk to my therapist to tell him about my diagnoses but he said he won't be discussing that with me because this is just for depression. 

I was really happy after I got diagnosed because I thought I could finally start getting the right help and get better eventually, but my mental health is getting worse.

I was wondering if there's any way I could get financial help that can cover the cost of DBT appointments and medication.

I'm currently 21 years old and female. I've always been an ""odd"" child - I was never to keen on joining clubs, I was often sat alone reading. Those things aren't too uncommon in children. 

As I got older, I realised that it was something more than just the anxiety and depression. I've never particularly enjoyed socialising anyway, but I've really struggled in making friends in life. I have one and I wouldn't be surprised if she's only my friend because I give her stuff. 

Anyway, me and my mom were watching that show on BBC/Channel 4 called The Autistic Gardener, or something along those lines. Anyway, my mom said that he guy on there was like a double of me - except he's male and I'm female, and he's a fair bit older than me.

0,wqzcy9,Are there any NHS mental health services other than iapts?,I need advice/support,"Trigger warning: mentions of self harm and suicide

I (22F) can't afford to go private - does the NHS actually provide any other mental health services, or is IAPTs all there is? 

I've tried IAPTS twice - the first time (CBT) I liked my therapist and used it more as counselling as the CBT approach didn't fit for me, it helped at the time but I was discharged at the start of covid so all the help was reversed. The second time (also CBT) I HATED my therapist, and ended up finishing early because it was making me worse.

I've been struggling a lot the last few years, and had a breakdown at the start of 2021. As the year went on I got worse, and by Winter 2021 I got to the point where I was self harming every day, had regular suicidal thoughts (and almost attempted one night) and felt like I was actually going insane. I don't mean that in a funny way, I genuinely felt like I was losing my mind - when driving I would regularly have to pull over and start screaming or sobbing. I needed help, but of course the GP just pointed me back in the direction of IAPTS. 

I had my assessment on 30th December 2021, explained everything that had been happening and how I felt like I was going crazy and was worried about myself, but requested counselling instead of CBT. They told me that the wait list for CBT was about 6 weeks whereas the wait list for counselling was 6 months. I chose to stick with counselling, because I'd rather wait a bit longer than do CBT again (I find CBT useless for myself). I told the lady that I was suicidal, and asked if there was any help I could get in the meantime - she emailed me the self harm and depression printouts from the Mind website and that's it. Very helpful (not). 

Anyway, almost 8 months later and I'm at the top of the waiting list - yay. Only problem is that I finished uni last month and am now working full time. A counsellor rang me last Wednesday and asked if I was available the following day for my first session. I explained that I work full time now and have less availability, and she huffed and told me that they're a 9-5 service so I 'might need to adapt' (as if I haven't spent the last 8 months 'adapting' whilst I was left to struggle without support). They gave the slot to someone else and said they'd ring again when another slot opens up. I've waited almost 8 months to get treatment, and now I might not even be able to attend the appointments. The annoying thing is that if I had been given treatment when I asked for it, I would have still been at uni and available for sessions most days.

I feel no relief at being at the top of the list. I don't know what I'm supposed to do about appointments as I can't afford to work part-time. I'm supposed to be applying for graduate jobs, but I don't know what I should apply for because of hours and IAPTs availability. I also know that the 12 sessions they provide probably aren't going to be enough to actually get through everything and actually help/provide long term results. I feel completely hopeless, like I'll never actually get better or the treatment I need unless I somehow come into money (or make an attempt which I don't want to do). At this point I don't even want to go ahead with the counselling, even though I've waited for so long because I feel no trust or hope for the service.

I feel like IAPTS is only really helpful for people showing early signs/first onset of mental illness with mild/moderate symptoms. For more complex and severe issues it just doesn't seem enough, it's like going to hospital with a broken leg and them giving you a plain bandage - sure it might stop it from getting worse, but it's not the appropriate treatment and won't heal it.

So yeah, is there anything else I can do, or is IAPTs all there is? Also if you have any advice about the 9-5 thing that would be great.",8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/wqzcy9/are_there_any_nhs_mental_health_services_other/,2022-08-17 20:33:39,22F
1,x5odlz,Reasons for losing interests and emotions,I need advice/support,"Hello all, I’m looking for reasons (other than depression) why I might be experiencing these changes.

In the past 6 months or so, I (22F) have basically lost interest in all hobbies. I am having a hard time feeling any  emotions. I have also completely lost interest in socialising.

I have of course questioned whether this is depression, but I really don’t feel any sadness. I just feel nothing.

Another reason I don’t think it’s depression is that I actually have a lot of motivation right now for my job, chores and working out. I’m not sure why I have motivation, because I’m not really enjoying these things. I have a work trip soon which I’m very excited about, but other than that, I feel no excitement for anything in life.",2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/x5odlz/reasons_for_losing_interests_and_emotions/,2022-09-04 14:31:55,22F
2,vf1pb0,Messed about by NHS MH team and it’s infuriating.,Vent,"Hi, sorry this might be a long one but I’m having so much trouble actually getting the help I (22F) need and not being listened to and I just want to document the issues I’ve been having with the NHS mental health services (understand they’re overworked and underfunded but I’m on about the rudeness) 

Had a telephone assessment in December with the First Response Team who sent me a letter of the outcome of their meeting about a month or two later. Letter stated I’m showing signs of eupd.

Had a rough patch again in April/May time which I then was going to the hospital at wits end desperately trying to get help. Well anyway, got assessment at the hospital and one of the woman doing doing the assessment was so rude. Told me my boyfriend won’t put up with my mental health issues forever which shocked me. I also mentioned at this assessment about a major traumatic event.  

Anyway, we came to the decision I’d have a home visit so they came a day or so later we spoke about things, spoke about what my outcome was, it went well. Said they were going to refer me for an assessment at the hospital. 

So last week I had that assessment and I don’t think I’d ever been more infuriated in my life lol. 
For starters, I explained about how my hatred for my appearance stops me from socialising. He told me that I’m “perfect and that everyone has things they don’t like about themselves.” Unhelpful. I understand he’s not a therapist but it was a bit invalidating. 

He had no record of that major traumatic life event that I mentioned earlier when I know I told the hospital because they gave me a green card with the specific hotline.

He asked me the outcome I wanted from this assessment and I said to get help with my anxiety so that I can actually get a job. He said he could refer me to the employment services but I have anxiety so he won’t. ??? Lol 

I told him about when I was having psychotherapy with the nhs services in 2019 and they suggested I do group therapy which at the time I couldn’t because I was very anxious and had college on those days. They said they wouldn’t drop me and would find something else only for them to discharge me and told me to come back when I left college (college was one of the reasons why I needed their services at the time, severe stress) 
He twisted my words and said “so you failed to comply.” 

I asked when I was going to actually be assessed by a psychiatrist to find out if I have any other mental health issues because I have such deep rooted childhood trauma which has messed me up. He said it’s just depression and anxiety and to keep doing therapy with vitaminds even though my therapist has been off sick for 3 weeks which he knows. They’ll get back to me in 4-8 weeks with the outcome. 

I feel so invalidated and unheard. Getting kinda sick of it now I just want help.",20,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/vf1pb0/messed_about_by_nhs_mh_team_and_its_infuriating/,2022-06-18 08:24:14,22F

4,pbf99l,Question: Studying Medicine with PTSD,I need advice/support,"22F.  I am going to be studying an MB ChB (medicine) in the UK, but I have a history of trauma and PTSD. My chosen university want to assess whether I am fit to study as it is a very demanding course. It is a conditional offer subject to them deeming me fit enough to study. 

I have been ok with my PTSD and I am self-managing my symptoms well, but the university wants a letter from my GP to prove this. My GP does not have my medical records on their system and it could take them a while to access it and I run the risk of missing my deadline to be passed as fit to study by the university. The GP says they cannot do an assessment on me without my medical records, so I would need to wait for them. But I cannot wait any longer without risking losing my place at medical school.

I am wondering, is it possible for me to be assessed privately by a licensed psychiatrist or medical doctor who will then be able to provide my university with information on my PTSD symptoms and how it is managed? Is this something that is feasible?

5,nzo27l,I’m really struggling and I want to seek help. I just don’t want my parents to know. What are my options in terms of confidentiality?,I need advice/support,"I (22F) have a bit of a difficult relationship with my parents. I moved back in with them in March and my mental health, which was already on a bit of a downward spiral, has really suffered ever since. Moving out isn’t an option for me right now (I’m a recent graduate and I’m currently unemployed) so I’m going to have to work around my family for now. The reason I’m wary of them knowing about my feelings is because they don’t really believe in mental health issues. I honestly find it pretty upsetting to even talk about their beliefs and so the idea of telling them I want to seek help is out of the question. I still want to move forward with seeking some kind of help, but I have some very specific questions that I hope this sub can maybe answer: 

1. I am still registered with my childhood GP, in a town around 10 miles away. I have no way of getting there as I can’t drive. Would I be able to switch to a more local GP without the rest of my family (who are all still registered there) being notified? 

2. I actually received counselling sessions from my university earlier this year. However, I cancelled the sessions when I moved home as all sessions were done via zoom and I was uncomfortable talking about my issues in front of my family (my dad works from home, my brother only works part time and my mother works unpredictable hours). Is face to face counselling available on the NHS? If not, Is there any way I can specify that I would like face to face counselling at a different location for the sake of confidentiality? If that isn’t possible, is there any way I could maybe communicate with a counsellor via text or email? 

3. Can my parents be alerted at all about anything I say? I am obviously an adult, but what happens if I need medication or if I need to be sectioned?  Would my parents be informed about this, since I live with them and they are my closest relatives? 

Any help or advice for going forward is massively appreciated. I know I’ve written loads here and I have some really specific questions but I just need some help to make sense of it all.

Life has been hell, i've quit my job, left uni etc but after 4 years i finally bit the bullet and went to my appointment at the gp for my depression. I am tired of being tired. Lost friends, lost interest and motivation and gained nearly 4 stone.   
Not even 5 minutes in she prescribed me with 20mg fluoxetine. I have a follow up appt in 2 weeks so see if things are working or need to increase or change. 

My doc suggested taking it in the morning as it can cause problems with sleep (which i already have). I was on amitriptyline for 6 weeks but i felt so tired and drowsy the next day so i had to stop.  
Day 1 - i took it at 8am, went back to sleep and woke up at 11am. No such side effects today and i hope it stays this way lol.

I have seen a lot of mixed reactions to fluo. My main concern is just gaining more weight. ive been trying to control it for a year but its been difficult. hardly lost 10lbs without gaining back.",7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/wrqnxo/fluoxetine/,2022-08-18 18:17:06,23F
1,spgmuf,I don't know what to do,I need advice/support,"For context, I (23F) have struggled with depression and self-harm in the past, particularly in my undergrad, which led me to getting put on antidepressants and doing a few rounds of therapy. It's worked well so far, but I think I'm having another episode now and idk what to do.

&#x200B;

A few situations have kind of led to me feeling shit lately - live in a small bedroom at my postgrad accommodation, long distance from my bf right now, family is far away, don't really feel like I can talk to the few friends I have. 

Basically, the last few weeks I've felt myself slipping more and more. The days are feeling so repetitive, I don't feel like I have anything to look forward to, and I just feel worthless. I've even had self-harm thoughts starting to creep back in, which hasn't happened for a long time.

Tonight, I took it out on my boyfriend of three years. He's been so supportive of me throughout this whole time and was just trying to help, but I just shut him down. He kept suggesting things I could do to help myself and, while I do want to feel better, I just don't feel like I have the energy or mental state to take any of those steps right now. 

After our conversation, I tried to see if I could find some free online therapy options in the UK (I'm financially dependent on my family rn as I do my postgrad course and money's really tight). I found one, but after answering all the questions, it said I wasn't eligible - presumably because my answers indicated my depression is too severe.

&#x200B;

I don't know where to turn. I feel like I can't talk to my boyfriend anymore about how I'm feeling, my family will just worry if I tell them the truth, and wait times for actual help like therapy are insane, and private counselling is kind of out of the question because £££. I should be in a better place come April and then June when I'm reunited with my boyfriend and we can move in together, but I don't want to rely on him for my mental health.

I don’t feel comfortable unpacking every little thing, even to a therapist, but even though I didn’t do anything seriously bad I’m more disturbed by the thought processes I had back then and what I thought was acceptable if that makes sense? Logically I could put it down to the fact children’s and teens brains aren’t fully developed but even so I was definitely a little confused and messed up. And that being said I LIKE the person I am now, I genuinely believe that I have a good heart and I would help anyone in a heartbeat, but then I think of how I was in the past and it’s like I can’t forgive myself and if anyone knew about how I was they would hate me, even though it’s clear I’ve changed and haven’t repeated any toxic behaviours for about 8 years now?

3,me1b5u,I’m really struggling with my mental health and I wanna quit my job because of it,Vent,"I’m 23F and have had depression and OCD for about 7 years, however my mental health has really declined in the past 6 months or so. I work in a supermarket, so working there in the middle of a pandemic when I struggle with contamination ocd anyway is already a struggle. I panic about spreading/catching germs every single day. One thing I can say about the general public is most have no sense of hygiene. People lick their fingers before giving me money, they sneeze into their hands before giving me money, they leave tissues and half eaten food that I have to touch to dispose of, and I know they don’t wash their hands because their fingernails are black and dirty. This always bothered me anyway but in the middle of the pandemic? It’s hard to not think I have covid at least once a week. I do think work is a massive contributing factor to my declining mental health. However I’m far too nervous to go to the doctors and get help. I would benefit from a long break however another girl recently got signed off with anxiety and the people I work with basically slated her for it because “we all have problems”. We are very understaffed so I understand the pressure it put on people I work with so I’m scared it’ll get even worse for them if I get signed off too, I’m terrified of confrontation (I often cry when having serious conversations with authority figures, I can’t help it and it’s so embarrassing that I often suffer in silence and avoid confrontation or difficult conversations altogether) and making people angry especially because I consider my coworkers my friends I don’t want them to resent me.

I do realise that I probably need to see a therapist. I haven’t even touched on how bad my depression has been, I’m at the lowest I’ve been in years. I feel stuck. I have little joy in my life, I feel like a drone who’s only purpose is to work, that’s practically all’s I’ve left the house to do all year. I’m doing the absolute bare minimum to function, I get about 5 hours sleep a night and I eat one meal a day then just snack, usually because I really just don’t care about myself and don’t care enough to make myself food. I don’t know how to get help without causing trouble at work but I can’t quit right now either because I can’t get a job elsewhere at the moment. So I’m putting it here to get it off my chest.

I did post on legal advice but though I should post on here too just in case anyone has any advice.
The situation at the moment is desperate. Really desperate. 
So my sister(24f) has long standing severe mental health issues and autistic spectrum disorder. (OCD, schizophrenia, PTSD traits)

She was diagnosed at age 12 but there were clear symptoms since she was about 8. She was under CAMHS(child and adolescent mental health services) from 13-16, then under EIP(early intervention in psychosis) from age 16-19, then transferred to adult community mental health services since she was 19.

At the moment she is convinced she’s in some sort of ‘experiment’, that everyone around her are one entity playing different characters, and that this has been happening since birth. Basically everyone is pretending to be her family/friend/doctor/waiter/shop assistant/etc literally Everyone in the world basically. She says back in may she saw video graphic evidence of a ‘friend’ holding up a sign telling her this. But she’s been convinced she’s been put in a simulation since 2014(age15)

Over the last 2 years she’s made 10+ suicide attempts such as overdoses etc which have landed her in A&E and some of which have gotten her sectioned and put in an inpatient unit. Psychiatrists have debated on the schizophrenia diagnosis. She’s tried various different medications. Which has not helped.

She was discharged suddenly from the psych unit at the start of August for assualting a staff member. Since January  the mental health team have told us they will no longer be putting her in an inpatient unit if she ends up back in A&E again after a suicide attempt because ‘hospital admissions aren’t helpful.’ But she is literally a danger to herself right now. We’ve been told that should she attempt again the hospital will treat her physically then send her home. This happened at the end of January after she took 80+ of her prescription tablets and a&e sent her home at 1am. She was shaking, could barely stand up and had to be held up exiting the hospital. Puked a few times.
Back in may she made another serious attempt and this time was hospitalised for some reason, but then discharged suddenly following the assualt. Since then mental health team have reiterated that they will not be putting her in hospital again and they don’t know why she was admitted in may. 
The medication she on is not doing anything and she’s not receiving therapy due to a waiting list. She ‘sees’ disturbing stuff frequently throughout the day and isn’t able to do anything to distract herself because of what she sees.
We can’t keep an eye on her 24/7 and one of these days I’m afraid it’ll be too late. We’ve already made a complaint back in February with minimal result.
I really don’t know what I can do to help her as I’m not a doctor or a proffesional but the actual ‘proffesionals’ wont help. Yes we tried going private but nowhere will take her due to the severity of her conditions. We forked out £140 for one meeting with a psychologist only for her to ring us back a week later saying she’s discussed with the NHS team and have decided she’s ‘better off with the NHS",18,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/xilewc/what_can_i_do_please_help_nhs_is_not_doing_enough/,2022-09-19 19:03:16,24F
1,q863l6,Making space for oneself whilst caring for a partner who struggles with their mental health,I need advice/support,"Hi there, 

I (26M) have been living with my partner (24F) for the duration of any/all lockdowns in the UK over the past 18 months. She is on a journey through anxiety and depression and whilst we have had our fair share of knocks this year, she has come so far and I am truly proud of her. 

I am doing my best as a layperson to support her in any way I can, from making her feel heard to support with medications/appointments etc. Recently however I have found myself getting frustrated/impatient an awful lot, particularly with household matters. She struggles with cleaning up after herself and with taking a share of the housework off of me (reduced or otherwise). Some days she has trouble leaving the house (understandably exacerbated by the lockdowns). I should also add we both work full time from home. None of these battles of hers are new, but these pangs of frustration on my side are. 

I’ve reflected on this a fair bit, and heard one common pitfall for people in my position is failing to ‘make space/time for themselves’. At the moment I can get out of the house for various things for a handful of hours a week, but in the house I struggle switching off from everything and enjoying time with my partner rather than viewing her as a collection of needs to be met. I should stress that I love her dearly and can clearly see that perception is deeply flawed and absolutely not a conscious choice, I just struggle not to focus on this when I am frustrated. My question is twofold. 

How specifically does one go about ‘making space for oneself’ within the home in the context of caring for someone who struggles with their mental health? And how do I communicate about this compassionately with my partner?

Once they're a little less busy (post-pandemic) I (24F) am thinking of going to the doctor about my mental health. I've been meaning to go again for a long time now. However, I would like to go in with an idea of what path to head down, rather than just giving them the list of symptoms I'm posting here and just hoping they have an idea.

I've been previously diagnosed with ""moderate anxiety and severe depression"" (took sertraline for a while, didn't work, stopped), however I've been wondering whether those things are a symptom of a bigger problem. My sister has ADHD and ASD, so I was thinking about asking along those sorts of lines; I've done research on both and their symptoms in women (adult and child), but I'd like to confer with those who would know more than myself in that regard.

I've listed all of the symptoms that I personally relate to that were either mentioned in the ADHD/ASD content I looked through or were thought of because of those things

Thanks

&#x200B;

Movement

* Constantly moving/shaking leg(s)
* Biting nails
* Cracking knuckles
* MUST pace when on the phone
* *Used to* scratch lightly up and down left upper-arm area when anxious (almost always when talking to someone new or “higher” than me)
* *Used to* clench fists, bring them up to near my head, overly clench mouth (like an “eeeeee!” or a too-big smile but too much) and vibrate(?) when excited
   * Now just shake wrists with arms down, and only rarely
      * If very excited, upper arms also tenses and arms come up to a 45-90 degree angle and do the same, but very rare

Sensory

* Sometimes noise-sensitive but not overly so
   * If something is too loud I hate it and it angers me and I can’t concentrate on anything else until it’s turned down or gone, but that bar is fairly high
* No sense of smell
* Aphantasia
* Very texture-based in eating; certain textures I cannot deal with (e.g.: stringy; I used to literally retch when cheese would string like on some pizzas, cannot eat anything with caramel for this reason)
   * This may just be because of the lack of taste caused by anosmia
* Love the feeling of certain fabrics
   * Not ones that are that commonly found, so it doesn’t happen much, but when it does I’ll rub them up and down from my right thumb to my wrist

Talking/Conversation

* Forget what I’m talking/thinking about midway through a sentence (sometimes randomly because my brain went on a tangent, sometimes it takes an external distraction for this to happen)
* Over-apologising
* Over-explaining, saying the same thing several times, to make sure people know
   * Sometimes even after topic of conversation has moved on
   * Often talking too quickly when doing this
   * Want to keep talking about it forever
* Oversharing
* Saying things that are inappropriate
* Sometimes find it difficult to know when to talk and interrupt too much (or finish someone’s sentences); sometimes very good at not doing that
* Struggle very very much to make eye contact
   * Used to not be able to at all, now can but only for short periods and I’m thinking about that the whole time and not what they’re saying
   * Receiving eye contact, especially prolonged, is uncomfortable
* HIGHLY aware of spacing of myself and the people around me
   * Same for voice volume

Feelings and Relationships

* Copy/duplicate/replicate/assimilate others’ personalities/habits/dreams
   * Don’t really have any long-term goals/dreams of my own; I end up with others’
* Feeling guilty all of the time
* Always worrying people are mad at me or hate me
   * X person didn’t want to do Y with me? They must hate me
   * Difficult for others to tell me that this is not the case, because it “feels” true to me
   * If people don’t like me, I can’t stand it or deal with it (unless I hate them)
      * I know it's unrealistic to want *everyone you meet* to like you and never think a bad thing about you, but that's how it is for me
* Rejection sensitivity
   * Very likely to anticipate, perceive, and react strongly (internally) to rejection
* Difficulty regulating emotions
* Find it very very difficult to say no to people
* Tendency to believe things that others do and say are about me (e.g.: he sighed because I’m annoying him)
* Very frustrated when things are slow or can’t/don’t happen RIGHT NOW
* Must do everything perfectly
   * If I can’t, “there’s no point even trying”
* Does not have many friends. I don’t mind this as to me quality > quantity.
   * Did not have any in school until Year 5/6 (age 8/9?), when I met one; would read or otherwise sit by myself until then
   * Had that one friend and only that one friend until halfway through college (age 18?)
   * Now have a small group of friends (6 including me and my boyfriend)
   * Used to be AWFUL at interacting with people, now good at faking it when meeting people (via uni, college, etc.), but it never becomes a “proper” friendship

Habits

* Executive dysfunction
   * Good at creating routines/plans/organising, BAD at following them long-term
      * I will go all-out creating this plan or organising something, and then do it for like 3 days and then forget and not use it again
      * Constantly setting calendar reminders for events
   * Always staying up late
   * Cannot seem to get into habit of brushing teeth every day
      * I know it’s awful but I literally haven’t since I was very young when I was made to
   * In general very short term > long term gratification
   * “Or I could just not \[do the thing\]”
* Will sometimes “autopilot” something or zone out
   * In the case of a task, I’ll be on autopilot for the whole thing
   * In the case of listening/watching/reading, I’ll realise partway through that I wasn’t listening/taking it in, and have to start again
* Doing several things at once (E.g.: Reading comments while watching YouTube videos, scrolling through internet while watching TV)
* Very low self-worth/self-esteem
* Having a hobby, REALLY into it for a short time, then not doing it for months or years, then back into it for a month, etc. etc.
* Procrastination BAD
   * Work done in short bursts, not over time
   * Last-minute panic sometimes necessary as a motivator
* Messy room
* That thing I do with letters near-constantly that I’ve not really told anyone about",5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/jyfsjn/adhd_asd_something_else_what_is_it/,2020-11-21 18:30:00,24F

I've always had problems with my mental health, I was diagnosed as clinically depressed at 13. Throughout the years since, I've been back and forth trying counselling, many medications, CBT, dietary changes, hitting the gym all to try to help. 

I've worked since leaving school 10 years ago, up until now being on furlough and a couple of years ago reached out to our local mental health people AGAIN after CBT did nothing. I saw a lady who told me I needed to see a gateway worker and after that its likely I would be put on the waiting list to see a psychologist.

The gateway worker after a few sessions told me that my issues are all circumstantial and that there would be no need to see me again. 

Months after this my boss ( who is extremely aggressive and likes to put her opinions on someone's mental health out there ) triggered a bit of a meltdown when she cornered me regarding me asking somewhere if they had any hours going. This was January so I was down to my contract hours after Christmas and needed a few more, someone at the place I enquired had told my boss that I was asking about work there because my hours had been cut, which was not what I had said at all. When my boss confronted me, I kept trying to hold back my tears as I tried to carry on with my shift. Later she took me upstairs for a 'meeting'. Through this meeting she confronted me about my feelings towards her for how badly she had treated me over Christmas ( this wasn't a one off ) she told me i was being unprofessional getting upset on the shop floor and she told me i should just ""go back to the gp and start again because clearly something isn't right with me"" or along those lines. 

Months later my Mum read an article about autism in females and guess what, it was like it had been written about me, is what she said. It explained all of my symptoms or 'traits' and would explain why nothing had helped with my mental health before. 

So I went to the GP regarding this in May 2019, end up being referred to the autism people and I get a diagnosis of fibromyalgia by the gp ( a ton of symptoms i had were misdiagnosed from the age of 5 when I had a sickness that triggered the fibro ) 

Anyway, I'm nearly a year and a half into the autism diagnosis process with no professional help or support, no support with the fibro and ( luckily ) still on furlough for now, but terrified to go back to work with the steep rise in new covid cases. I'm frequently feeling suicidal but don't want to kill myself, I'm staying at my fiancé's Mum's house with him at the moment but my 'home' is a house share 66 miles away where I work near to, and I don't drive so worried for when I have to go back. My mum and fiance have been really supportive but I need professional support, how I feel is getting out of hand, causing horrific insomnia which also lowers my immune system. 

I'm not sure what to do, every time 1 little thing goes right, 2 or 3 things go wrong. I turn 28 on Saturday, and the steep rise in covid cases has been happening. There's a lot more to my story but for now, this is where I'm at. If anyone has any advice or suggestions for things that might help, it would be greatly appreciated.",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/iyl3n2/ongoing_issues_and_receiving_zero_professional/,2020-09-23 22:47:20,10 female

1,v66njj,Is this appropriate from a psychiatrist? I need some advice…,I need advice/support,"I am under a CMHT and have been seeing this psychiatrist for the past year. He saw me a total of 12 times and 7 of them was during a 2 month period. I was very surprised why he saw me so frequently as that’s very unusual in my experiences with community teams.

I have a history of sexual abuse as a child and he asked about this in one of the appointments. He asked for details such as how frequently it happened, when it happened and what happened etc… He even asked me if I enjoyed it (referring to rape), which I felt was way out of line. I felt his questions was intrusive and inappropriate. I didn’t see why he needed to know everything he asked for as a psychiatrist. 

He asked about my sexuality, any past or current relationship etc. And a lot more very personal questions about my background which made me felt very uncomfortable. At times it felt like he was paying a special attention to me because I was the same race as him. He is practicing in the UK but he is not originally from the UK. 

He also asked me to sit closer to him on several occasions as I usually prefer sitting further away. I didn’t protest against it but he could see I was uncomfortable. And it just made me felt so unsafe when I was seeing him alone by myself without a chaperone.

I mean nothing really happened but I was so scared afterwards and due to my history with sexual abuse, I can’t help but think what danger I might have been in had this clinical relationship with him continued. Fortunately it is now ended and I’m safe.

I don’t know if he genuinely think what he asked was necessary or he was abusing his power to get what he wanted to hear. It was a very awkward 1-1 conversation to have with a male psychiatrist (I’m female). I felt he was out of line but I’m not sure. It could also be my paranoia because of psychosis or misunderstanding the social situation because of my ASD.

Is it out of line? Or am I overreacting?",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/v66njj/is_this_appropriate_from_a_psychiatrist_i_need/,2022-06-06 15:52:54,12 female
6,mdocvy,Home Treatment/Crisis Team Help,I need advice/support,"Hi all! 

First time poster here. Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this kind of post, let me know and I will be happy to move it somewhere more appropriate. 

So a brief bit of background: young female progessional, MH issues since young teenager, received some support in UK while at uni, then multiple hospitalizations for SI/depression while abroad. Have moved around a lot since returning to the UK so referrals have never actually seen results. Frequent A&E attender in past year due to desperate need for support. Currently referred to step 3 CBT and was just put under care of Home Treatment (HBT) following A&E attendence. Multiple past attempts and most recent led to a 7 day stay in a local crisis house. 

Okay, so the issue. I attended A&E last night with SI and was placed under care of HBT. I was told they would call me this morning and arrange to see me within 48 hours of the referral. They called early afternoon and said they can see me Sunday afternoon (so 3 days after referral). Okay, fine, they're busy, I get that. They said the usual ""go back to A&E or call the crisis line if you feel worse"" malarkey. But... It's Friday. I feel absolutely awful. I absolutely 100% cannot make it until Sunday afternoon. I don't want to call my GP because I'm under care of HBT. I feel like i can't call HBT because 1) they told me to call the crisis line or go to A&E and 2) Nobody told me i could use their number. I don't want to call 111 because they will send an ambulance and I feel that's a waste of resources. I don't really want to go to A&E because I was Literally Just There 12 Hours Ago. And I ESPECIALLY do not want to call the crisis line because I'm really not in the mood to be told to take a bath or think positive. So like... Do i have any other options? Idk. 

Anyway, any thoughts/advice/experiences welcome, and I hope you're all staying safe and well :)


EDIT: Contacted the Crisis Team multiple times and didn't get through to talk to anybody. Tried calling Mind and same thing. Used the Shout text service twice. Managed to stay safe.

EDIT: Have since been in the general hospital and under HBT again. Was discharged as it want a ""suitable service"" for me. Now have no support.",3,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/mdocvy/home_treatmentcrisis_team_help/,2021-03-26 13:13:33,12 female

'After moving to Cove in Argyll & Bute on the West Coast of Scotland to deal with Maries’ Mental Health problems, we started taking daily walks on the many amazing beaches and Lochs that surround this beautiful area as a way of helping with Maries therapy and found that it worked in helping Marie to forget about her PTSD, Depression and Anxiety problems for a short while. 

Marie started collecting the many different beautiful colours of sea glass, shells & pottery that had been naturally tumbled by the sea over years, decades and sometimes even centuries. As with many people with Mental Health problems, Marie suffered a big relapse and after some excellent treatment with the Drs and PCT team, Marie decided one day to try & make a necklace using some sea glass and we both quickly realised how talented Marie was as a jewellery maker. I also noticed from a personal view how at peace Marie was with herself when she was making jewellery and Hey Presto ARGYLLSEAGLASS was born, making handmade jewellery Argyll Scotland.'

0,y7elgv,CMHT Experience,I need advice/support,"Hello, friends.

I am under a Community Mental Health Team in the East Midlands and I have to ask, because there seems to be so little information out there, what the is wrong with CMHTs?!

Context: I am considered long-term disabled due to mental health conditions. I am officially diagnosed with anxiety and ""trauma"" (my psych evaluation doesn't specify C-PTSD or PTSD, just ""trauma"", but I understand it to be C-PTSD). I was diagnosed with BPD in 2019 but had a new assessment in 2022. I have a ADHD diagnosis and am on the waiting list for an autism assessment. I am in my early 30s and female.

I had to almost physically tussle with my GP to refer me to CMHT, optimistic that CMHT would help a gal out as it is allegedly a service for those with ""long term and complex"" mental health conditions/mental illness. I was assessed by someone in February who assured me I would be able to access ""trauma informed/specialist care."" I have just had my second session with a practitioner who is delivering ""Emotional First Aid"" to me on a 1:2:1 basis. It is a 6 week course which essentially is someone telling me over Teams that I just need to write a pros and cons list to any ""bad"" behaviour and - like magic! - my brain will simply comply. I made my concerns pre this ""course"" that I am not someone CBT-esque therapy works on too well due to neurodivergency and trauma and in my psych evaluation in the summer, I was assured that this course is to assess my ""motivation"" to engage with the services. I am therefore playing nice and desperately trying to avoid being accused of being volatile/argumentative but also advocate for myself to get the correct sort of support. I have had professionals discriminate against me for this before because they don't like that I am intelligent, well informed and well educated when it comes to psychology, particularly trauma.

Essentially, I want EDMR. I am exceptionally good at analysing and intellectualising my emotions. I have experienced several traumatic events and I believe I need to access some long term support in order to process this and hopefully, finally, make lasting and healthy changes. I am very active when it comes to my own mental health care. I do everything ""right"", so to speak. I exercise, I eat (relatively) well, I even meditate. The one thing I don't do at the moment is taking medication for my mental health although I have done this in the past. I recently has a psych appointment regarding medication and they've essentially shoe-horned me into trying sertraline again. I'm not anti-medication but I know it's an attempt to palm me off and avoid giving me long-term care.

Does anyone have any advice on how to calmly yet firmly deal with CMHT in order to get what I need? I am doing my best to present as very grateful and in no way argumentative but I am determined to force their hand. I won't accept that this 6-week CBT-light course is sufficient care for someone with a lifelong history of mental illness. I am playing their game and going along with it despite it being offensive and patronising. This is supposed to be a service for people with COMPLEX and LONG TERM mental illness and I'm sat across from someone who is essentially saying ""hey, have you tried just, like, not being sad?"".

I would appreciate hearing people's experiences, any advice, any victories, but also any validating and similar experiences. I'm sorry if you've also had a bad experience. It's a truly sad state of affairs. But I remain hopeful. I work part-time and I study part-time and due to my conditions I find it difficult to hold down a job, especially a full time one, so I'm in no position to pay for therapy at the moment. I also live in a rural town. I did manage to access excellent therapy from charities when living in a UK city, I actually got 13 months of free therapy this way and it was so helpful. I just still have a long way to go but I'm at the mercy of my local NHS services.

Thanks in advance.",7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/y7elgv/cmht_experience/,2022-10-18 18:20:18,13 female
1,xjk4lc,Absolutely done in,I need advice/support,"** TW Health Anxiety/Symptom Details**






So this morning I woke up at 6:40 from flashing in my head almost as if my life was literally flashing by my eyes as my eyes were closed.. if that makes sense. I ran to the toilet as I felt like I was going to puke or have diarrhoea. Sometimes when I get the feeling of diarrhoea my anxiety somehow comes on and in that moment I think this is it. 

However as I rushed to the bathroom I started getting flushes and cold sweats. I thought I honestly was having a heart attack, I completely freaked out and woke up my partner. I experience serve anxiety attacks but never like this. 

I called out of hours service (Scotland) but was almost hanging up to dial 999. I’ve never done this with any anxiety attack before and I know woman experience heart attacks differently than men, so I thought this is it. Now with that in mind I’m a 26 female fairly active but a smoker so you never know. 

Anyways, I’m really at my wits end with how I’m feeling and was wondering if anyone knew of any medication or anything that will stop this feeling of dread and fear of death. I’ve dealt with this since I was 13, so that’s 13 years of hell. 

I’m on 20mg of fluoxetine and have been since the start of the year. My doctor has offered to increase but doesn’t want to as the side effects are too much for my anxiety riddled brain to deal with. 

I’m honestly absolutely terrified to fall asleep now after this morning.",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/xjk4lc/absolutely_done_in/,2022-09-20 20:48:12,13 female

8,k1f0li,Just a bit of a vent tbh,Vent,"I was always the weird kid. I’ve never made friends easily, and I’ve always been the outcast. I remember in PE, I was only ever picked first in rounders/baseball, because I can hit the ball just far enough. The rest of the time, I was last to be picked, and even then, I was left out of everything. 

My primary school was so small that most people hung out with me, because there was no one else – my year group was >15 people. When I got to high school, I had no friends for the first year. I eventually did make some friends, but I fell into the wrong crowd. My mental health dipped, along with my physical health. 
As I got through high school, I got bullied daily over anything and everything; from the way I look to having a lisp. I ignored it all, but deep down, my mental health only got worse. I’ve tried to find outlets other than self-harm, but none of them suffice. Nothing is just enough. 

Getting into sixth form, I was talking to people – they didn’t consider me a friend. But even then, the conversations felt forced. I took to being alone, but it wasn’t much help. I had one friend in a lesson, we used to be “friends” in year 7/8. She stopped hanging out with me because, and I quote, “[her boyfriend] thinks you’re weird”. So I went back to being alone. 

I was a volunteer for nearly ten years and even there, I didn’t feel like I had a friend. I left in January 2020 because it was just unbearable in the end. I work now, full time, and I don’t feel like anyone there is a friend for me. 

I’ve always struggled socially – my mom thinks I could be on the autism spectrum, though she never thought it when I was younger, and my doctors won’t test me now (because I’m 21, female and have a full time job). I can’t afford to pay for private testing (one session is an entire month’s wage for me). I feel like I have no friends. 

I had a boyfriend – it started out chill, but then he turned abusive. Now I have no one. I’m so sick of being alone, and I don’t know how much longer I want to live a life with no one around me. I had therapy – they stopped it because I couldn’t do phone appointments, the only time I tried one, I had a major panic attack. So phones aren’t there for me either. 

I’m so sick of being alone.

1,ozzq6u,Help and Advice please.,I need advice/support,"Hi all. 

So I am 22 years old and female. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD when I was 18. In the space of a year I seen my friend get killed, found my dad dead and my little cousin passed away. 

Since then I’ve been homeless, struggled with my mental health, my relationship, University, impulsive behaviours etc. I am on 150mg Sertraline, done CBT, talking therapy and EMDR. 

Past year I have been in and out of hospital constantly due to gynochological issues, which has effected my life, work life and University very much. I have had 3 admissions in 2 months. I also just recently lost my nana, however I wasn’t very close to her. 

I have always been quite positive and resilient, never give up and always try but for the past two weeks I just feel like numb and empty, like everything is pointless, nothing is making me happy, I’m constantly exhausted, but bored at the same time. And even though mental health is something I have always struggled with, this time it seems different. I feel like I have lost my spark. Just like miserable, like I’m on auto pilot and the things I used to do to help me like exercise, self care etc, isn’t working. Just not sure whats going on or what to do",12,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/ozzq6u/help_and_advice_please/,2021-08-07 19:31:35,18 female
11,djaa0h,I am scared I will die under my mental health services,None,"First of all, apologies for the long post. For context, I am a 20 year old female university student who has struggled with mental health problems for a decade, having an eating disorder in my teens and depression and anxiety throughout. I have a previously experienced sexual trauma and alcohol misuse.

Last month, I went to A&E after having an urge to jump in front of a train. I was referred to the crisis mental health service and home treatment team for 18-25 year olds in my area.  During this period, I had a tense relationship with my housemates and rarely left my room, often going days without eating or speaking to anyone; no one ever checked up on me when I had not been seen for days and I was genuinely concerned I would die in my room and not be found for days. I had two visits from mental health nurses before having a medical review by a psychiatrist.  The assessment was over relatively quickly and I believe that it was rushed and that I wasn’t taken seriously. My psychiatrist seemed to attribute my mental health crisis solely to a recent breakup that had occurred a month prior, even though, whilst it was painful, I had already tried to access mental health treatment months prior to this.  My psychiatrist made a joke, which I politely laughed at, to which he said “see you can’t be that sad, you’re smiling”. He also asked me “what do you want to do when you graduate?” which I instinctively answered, to which he said “so you don’t really want to die then?” completely ignoring the fact that I was literally in A&E 3 days prior because I wanted to die. His judgement was to discharge me from crisis, despite me saying that I was incredibly suicidal, that I was self harming and drinking daily, and that no one was checking up on me. When I told my GP about this, she made a formal complaint saying that I should clearly still be under crisis.

The days following, my mental health deteriorated even further to the point where I could no longer keep myself safe at university. I called the crisis line run by the service to which they told me to “try calming music” when I told them I was suicidal. I had told the nurse on my first appointment about my past sexual trauma and other traumas, yet when I mentioned this to different nurses, they seemed surprised like they were not aware, suggesting that these events weren’t on my notes or my nurses hadn’t read them and just assumed I was upset over a breakup. I decided that I would go to my family home for a week that weekend. I spoke to my mental health nurse that Thursday that I was going home on Sunday and therefore needed medication before that. I was told that I would receive it on Saturday via a home visit, yet they never came. I went home without medication, and luckily had a friend who was on the same medication as me who gave me enough to last that week.

When I was back at my family home, I took an overdose and was taken to hospital. I decided to still return to university, as my education was the only thing I had left and without it, I knew I would feel like I lost everything and had no purpose. Additionally, staying at home all day would just depress me even more. I told the hospital that I felt like my mental services weren’t helpful, to which they said they would file a complaint for me. 

It took my mental health services five days to contact me after my overdose. Eventually when they did contact me, it was to deliver my medication. I told the nurse over the phone that I was not in as I was currently driving up, and he said that someone would deliver it tomorrow. He then asked how I was, to which I said “not well, I was in hospital”, to which he replied saying “oh we know”. The next day, when I returned, another nurse visited me to deliver my medication. She was completely unaware of my overdose. I spoke to my university wellbeing services the next day, and another complaint was filed.

Exactly a week after my overdose, I was sexually assaulted after a first date. It left me in pain and bleeding for two days. I called the crisis line again two days after my assault, crying and being unable to breathe saying that I wanted to end my life. The respondent handed over to his shift manager and rather than calm me down, caused me more distress, stating that “he might have to call police as this is a safeguarding issue” despite my adamance to not report it due to having friends traumatised by reporting assault. He also said that I was a “smart girl” who should “avoid being sectioned under the Mental Health Act because employers would be able to see”. He made no effort to calm me down and the call ended within ten minutes. I ended up calling 111 who had to call an ambulance. I was so distressed that I locked myself out of the house for hours in the middle of the night in the rain, sitting on my doorstep so I would not harm myself.

I was taken to A&E again, was medically examined for any internal damage from my assault and then sent to a psychiatric decisions unit at a local psychiatric hospital. The following morning, my psychiatrist and another nurse came to assess me. They increased my dosage and took all my medication away so that someone could give me my medication daily so that I wouldn’t overdose. They asked me about my assault and how I felt, to which I said “honestly I wish my overdose worked because if it did none of this would have happened”. My psychiatrist replied saying “That’s a strange way to look at things, what about if you weren’t intoxicated and went home in the cab on your own? What if you went out with someone you properly knew?” He essentially blamed me for my own assault.

I saw my GP again today and another complaint has been filed, and my therapist has also filed a complaint, but I’m exhausted. I’ve literally tried to take my own life and I feel like the care I’ve been given is awful. I understand that mental health services are strained and that nurses are stressed and overworked, but it is so draining to go through this. All my psychiatric care has done has caused me even more psychological distress. I don’t know what else I can do, I feel so let down",9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/djaa0h/i_am_scared_i_will_die_under_my_mental_health/,2019-10-17 18:13:05,18 female

6,hklra6,"Absolutely shocked at how easily people ""fall through the cracks"" or are outright neglected by the system",None,"First post and this may come out as a very long rant, there's a lot of stuff I'm trying to process and I want to stay constructive but I feel like I'm just at my wits end in regard to my current situation so I apologise in advance.

For the last couple of years a man (we will call him ""A"") has popped in and out of my local church, often requesting support in one form or another. Sometimes it is basic financial support, other times it is help with filling out forms or helping him understand letters from the local housing association, his utilities suppliers etc. English is not his first language and he has a lot of difficulty communicating, he is an immigrant who has been in the UK with his mother for more than 20 years. Although he has no official diagnosis he shows many symptoms of what would be considered ""classic"" autism and while I am no mental health expert I do believe over the years he has displayed many symptoms which could point towards psychosis.

Over the past 6 months his situation has gotten worse. He claims that his neighbours are trying to harm him and has started phoning the emergency police line claiming his neighbours are attacking him and even trying to kill him. In each case there is no evidence to support his claim while there is often counter-evidence to prove what he is saying is not true. He has also accused the people who are contracted to clean his council flat of abuse as well as the police themselves, in the case of the cleaners there was evidence that he was the one who was abusive and violent. Despite all these run-ins with the police, no one has stepped in to investigate the situation in any official capacity. During all of this time, the minister of my church has been requesting support from social services but took literally months for them to even both trying to contact ""A"" and then all they did was try to ring him a few times and when he didn't answer his phone, they gave up.

As I mentioned, he lives with his mother. She is elderly, speaks almost no English and recently had a  transient ischaemic attack. While they are both receiving the full spectrum of benefits payments that they are entitled to, he is expected to do all the practical care work for his mother himself. Given his condition, we suspect that it is more likely that she is the one caring for him. After months and months of finally arranging a situation where social services could meet with ""A"", COVID19 lockdown happens and his case is considered non-essential, so the meeting is cancelled. The TIA that his mother suffered causes her to have angry and abusive outbursts, which ""A"" is simply not equipped to deal with. With the both of them confined in their flat during lockdown, things have reached a boiling point and during one of her episodes ""A"" assaulted his mother, who then phoned the police and he was arrested and charged with ""assault by beating"". Despite his mother having very clear bruising which could only have been caused by ""A"" putting his hands on her, he was absolutely adamant that he was innocent and showed genuine confusion as to why he was being prosecuted.

Since his arrest, I spoke to another church pastor who had been involved with trying to help him several years ago. It turns out that ""A"" has a long history of anti-social behaviour and exposing himself to women in public. After speaking to ""A's"" doctor, I found out that he is not allowed to see a female doctor or a nurse unless he is accompanied by another man. Apparently despite his inappropriate behaviour towards woman at the GP surgery (they would not specify what it was) , they never considered him a risk to the public?! 

Fast forward to today and I find out that the case against him is being dropped... and he will be free to return to live with his mother. Social services are trying to encourage him to move out so that they can help him find a place of his own and support him, however if he chooses to return to live with his mum  (which is most likely what he will do) social services have said that they will not get involved. I honestly cannot believe sending him to go live with his mother without assistance is even an option after everything has happened. I'm just in total shock that ""A"" and his mother have been living here for literally decades and have basically just been left to fend for themselves.  If anyone made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read this, I'm sorry that there is no happy ending but I just needed to get this out.",13,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/hklra6/absolutely_shocked_at_how_easily_people_fall/,2020-07-03 16:08:16,20 female

0,k1f0li,Just a bit of a vent tbh,Vent,"I was always the weird kid. I’ve never made friends easily, and I’ve always been the outcast. I remember in PE, I was only ever picked first in rounders/baseball, because I can hit the ball just far enough. The rest of the time, I was last to be picked, and even then, I was left out of everything. 

My primary school was so small that most people hung out with me, because there was no one else – my year group was >15 people. When I got to high school, I had no friends for the first year. I eventually did make some friends, but I fell into the wrong crowd. My mental health dipped, along with my physical health. 
As I got through high school, I got bullied daily over anything and everything; from the way I look to having a lisp. I ignored it all, but deep down, my mental health only got worse. I’ve tried to find outlets other than self-harm, but none of them suffice. Nothing is just enough. 

Getting into sixth form, I was talking to people – they didn’t consider me a friend. But even then, the conversations felt forced. I took to being alone, but it wasn’t much help. I had one friend in a lesson, we used to be “friends” in year 7/8. She stopped hanging out with me because, and I quote, “[her boyfriend] thinks you’re weird”. So I went back to being alone. 

I was a volunteer for nearly ten years and even there, I didn’t feel like I had a friend. I left in January 2020 because it was just unbearable in the end. I work now, full time, and I don’t feel like anyone there is a friend for me. 

I’ve always struggled socially – my mom thinks I could be on the autism spectrum, though she never thought it when I was younger, and my doctors won’t test me now (because I’m 21, female and have a full time job). I can’t afford to pay for private testing (one session is an entire month’s wage for me). I feel like I have no friends. 

I had a boyfriend – it started out chill, but then he turned abusive. Now I have no one. I’m so sick of being alone, and I don’t know how much longer I want to live a life with no one around me. I had therapy – they stopped it because I couldn’t do phone appointments, the only time I tried one, I had a major panic attack. So phones aren’t there for me either. 

I’m so sick of being alone.

1,sgge5g,Losing hope of making any friends,Vent,"I’m a 21 year old guy, and it’s sad to admit, but I don’t have any friends. I’ve never exactly had the best record when it comes to friendships. I can’t say I’ve ever had a best friend, or even a close friend. I’m becoming really lonely but I’m struggling to make any new friends. I moved to a new city in September last year and I hoped things would get better. I come from a small rural place, so I thought there would be plenty of opportunities to make friends, but I’ve had no luck yet.

So I’m a trans guy, meaning I was born a female but identify as male. It’s definitely not something I go around shouting about, but it’s something that really holds me back, and is part of the reason I seem to have problems making friends. In terms of my appearance, I look like a guy, but as soon as I open my mouth, my voice is so high, and it just gives it away. Even though I look like a guy from my appearance, I look way younger than most guys my age. I can’t transition yet due to family issues so I’m just stuck in this awkward in between. I feel uncomfortable around my family because I don’t feel they care about me if I’m being who I am. For the family members who’d don’t know I’m trans, I doubt they will want to associate with me when they do find out. Yes, I know I’m 21, and I can technically do what I like, but it’s not as easy as that when I’m financially dependent on them. As a result of all this, I have absolutely zero confidence, and I’m finding it more and more difficult to leave the house. I’ve always been shy and introverted so this doesn’t help.

I don’t really seem to fit in with LGBT people or non-LGBT people. A lot of LGBT people I have met were very vocal about their identity and were somewhere on the gender spectrum, rather than the binary male or female with how they identified. I by no means have a problem with that, but I’m someone who just wants to get on with life as a guy and be able to fit in with people. I guess the problem is that other people like me might not necessarily hang out in specific LGBT spaces. I did end up going to a trans youth group in the city which was both a blessing and a curse. It was cool to meet other people like me, but they’ve all been able to transition and get on with their lives, while I’m just stuck. I found it hard to socialise with them because they had things going on in their lives, where I just feel like I’m not going anywhere or doing anything. I’m not only trying to make friends with LGBT people, but I can tell sometimes that people don’t know whether I’m a boy or girl, and I feel like I make people feel awkward. I’ve also tried making friends on social media, but most people have their own friends and don’t need anymore, so they sometimes reply for a bit or not at all. I feel a bit pathetic, because I have a bit more confidence online, but still people don’t want to talk to me. 

I don’t feel like I can move forward in life, because with anything I try to do, I’m having to explain I’m trans to people as soon as I meet them or otherwise I just stick out. The way I’m living my life at the minute seems to be for other people’s benefit and not my own. I feel like I’m falling behind and just wasting my life, because I’m stuck in my room thinking of goals and dreams that seem unachievable. I’m living in my head a lot, dreaming about the future and being surrounded by people who care. As time passes, I seem to have less control over this loneliness, as I’m running out of ways to try and meet new people, and I don’t know if things will ever change. No one seems to speak to me unless I initiate the conversation. I feel I’m not even seen a lot of the time or just forgotten about in the background. Everyone I meet seems to have a significant other or at least one friend, so I’m not exactly anyone’s priority. This loneliness is really starting to get to me and I never have anyone to talk to, because I can’t even relate to people who are vaguely similar to me, and there doesn’t seem to be anyone out there in a situation like mine.

Honestly, it would just simply be cool to have a friend. I’m not saying they’d have to be trans, because it’s not something I fixate on or talk about a lot. I know this post shows the exact opposite, but it’s just causing me a lot of problems at the moment. Just someone who would just accept me for who I am and then we could get on with doing fun stuff as mates. Whenever I go out and see people hanging out together, I think I’d love to have someone I could go to the cinema or the beach with, anything really. I’m not even asking for a group of mates, just one person would be amazing. I’m sort of hopeful there may be someone on here in somewhat of the same position, but at the same time I hope no one is feeling the same way I do. I just needed to vent this somewhere, and sorry it’s so long, but if anyone wants or needs someone to talk to, please feel free to message me. Thanks guys",8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/sgge5g/losing_hope_of_making_any_friends/,2022-01-30 19:13:21,21 female
4,ms3qfe,"Medication, your experience with it, help",I need advice/support," 

I'm a 21 year old female. Last year I started looking into getting help with my mental health, now I've finally gotten to the stage of getting medication for whatever the hell is going on with me (the reason for the long wait is the NHS). I have what I personally call chronic anxiety, anything and everything can make me feel anxious, lack of sleep, paranoia, procrastination when it comes to doing work and uni stuff, sometimes it gets to the point of me being depressed. Another major issue is me most likely having an emotionally unstable personality disorder (or bpd). Had my first appointment with a psychiatrist he recommended a mix of CBD and medication, he also mentioned that he will try his best to get me into DBT (if possible, apparently it's not available everywhere). I received a list of options for the medication and honestly idk which one to choose, all of them are SSRI ofc

1. Fluoxetine (from what I've read so far, this one seems to have the most side effects)
2. 2.Sertraline
3. 3.Citalopram (atm this one looks like the best option)

What has your experience with any of these drugs been, do you have any recommendations? Thanks in advance.

P.S. - I know that everyone's experience is different and you can't predict the side effects AND that it takes a while for them to actually start working but what worries me the most is not being able to concentrate, gaining weight, having nightmares. I'm just tryna finish my stupid uni degree and currently, I'm the one who's holding me back from being able to finish it, I'm just hoping that medication and therapy will help me.",6,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/ms3qfe/medication_your_experience_with_it_help/,2021-04-16 13:59:02,21 female
6,mmxo1o,Finally Getting There,Uplifting,"It's took over two years. I was told that because I'm female, 21 and working successfully that there's no symptoms. I pushed it again earlier this week and fucking finally.

I'm on the waiting list for testing adults with autism. 

I found a good doctor in Hull. I spoke to him about my observations and those of others around me.

I went through the AQ10 with him and got 9 out of 10 (6 or more is suggested to get tested).

Its a long waiting list, in the region of two years. *However,* it's progress and I finally feel listened to.

As I said to my doctor, it's not the label. It's the understanding that I'd gain. I'd understand why I have these quirks, and I'd know how to handle things better.

Yay me.",24,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/mmxo1o/finally_getting_there/,2021-04-08 18:05:47,21 female
7,j2l26u,Autism in 21F?,I need advice/support,"Okay, it's a long one. 

I'm currently 21 years old and female. I've always been an ""odd"" child - I was never to keen on joining clubs, I was often sat alone reading. Those things aren't too uncommon in children. 

As I got older, I realised that it was something more than just the anxiety and depression. I've never particularly enjoyed socialising anyway, but I've really struggled in making friends in life. I have one and I wouldn't be surprised if she's only my friend because I give her stuff. 

Anyway, me and my mom were watching that show on BBC/Channel 4 called The Autistic Gardener, or something along those lines. Anyway, my mom said that he guy on there was like a double of me - except he's male and I'm female, and he's a fair bit older than me. 

I had a friend who's autistic, though we parted after college. I've considered that I could be on the spectrum, but because I'm female, twenty one and I have a relatively good job, the doctors have entirely ruled it out on me. 

I know that I shouldn't just google things, but when I look at some of the symptoms, I have a lot of them. My previous therapist also said that he believes I would be quite high on the spectrum, though my doctors won't bother to test me because ?????

I don't want the diagnosis, or test, for a label. I just want answers, I have so many questions about myself that I don't have an answer to. 

There's nothing about getting privately tested here in my city, the closest is a good hour or so away, and highly expensive - which no one can afford (like £1200 per appointment, that's my entire months wage). 

I don't know what to do, where to turn and I'm struggling to get an answer to all these questions that I have. Does anyone know anything I could do? I'm at a breaking point

I pushed my doctors again and again and they categorically said no.",9,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/j2l26u/autism_in_21f/,2020-09-30 12:21:26,21 female
0,ozzq6u,Help and Advice please.,I need advice/support,"Hi all. 

So I am 22 years old and female. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD when I was 18. In the space of a year I seen my friend get killed, found my dad dead and my little cousin passed away. 

Since then I’ve been homeless, struggled with my mental health, my relationship, University, impulsive behaviours etc. I am on 150mg Sertraline, done CBT, talking therapy and EMDR. 

Past year I have been in and out of hospital constantly due to gynochological issues, which has effected my life, work life and University very much. I have had 3 admissions in 2 months. I also just recently lost my nana, however I wasn’t very close to her. 

I have always been quite positive and resilient, never give up and always try but for the past two weeks I just feel like numb and empty, like everything is pointless, nothing is making me happy, I’m constantly exhausted, but bored at the same time. And even though mental health is something I have always struggled with, this time it seems different. I feel like I have lost my spark. Just like miserable, like I’m on auto pilot and the things I used to do to help me like exercise, self care etc, isn’t working. Just not sure whats going on or what to do",11,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/ozzq6u/help_and_advice_please/,2021-08-07 19:31:35,22 female

1,ovetie,Anyone fancy a chat?,Looking for a mental health buddy,"I've been looking for like-minded people for some time now but I'm starting to think I've been searching in all the wrong places. Either people are half around the globe or interested in one thing and one thing only (starting with 'S' and ending in 'X') so figured I'd look closer to home, where people have a mutual understanding of mental health. I also find that many people with mental health issues are creative. One thing that gets me up on a morning is to take pictures of the wildlife by my home. The birds fascinate me and ease my mind, they also make me feel less alone at times but lets keep that between you and I. I like to draw and colour, not that I'm any good but I do enjoy it. 

Oh and I probably should include that I'm a 23 year old female, live at home with my parents and brother, have a history of studying Health and Social Care but my passion underlays with the Arts.
