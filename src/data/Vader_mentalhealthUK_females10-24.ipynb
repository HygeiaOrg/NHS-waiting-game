I guess what I’m saying is that I feel really guilty because she’s always helping us out with money but I also feel like I can’t keep doing this anymore. If being an adult is this constantly stressful, I don’t know if I want to live anymore. Maybe it’s just a bump in the road but I’m so exhausted of dealing with this stuff, I’m so scared that I’m never going to get a chance to heal because the whole world is totally against anyone who is struggling. I want to have a decent and happy life but it feels impossible right now and I don’t know if it’s worth sticking it out. Does anyone else feel like this? With the current situation it isn’t easy to seek help and I’ve felt like this so many times before that I just don’t believe it will get better anymore.\n",

I moved back in with them in March and my mental health, which was already on a bit of a downward spiral, has really suffered ever since. Moving out isn’t an option for me right now (I’m a recent graduate and I’m currently unemployed) so I’m going to have to work around my family for now. The reason I’m wary of them knowing about my feelings is because they don’t really believe in mental health issues.

Is face to face counselling available on the NHS? If not, Is there any way I can specify that I would like face to face counselling at a different location for the sake of confidentiality?

I moved back in with them in March and my mental health, which was already on a bit of a downward spiral, has really suffered ever since. Moving out isn’t an option for me right now (I’m a recent graduate and I’m currently unemployed) so I’m going to have to work around my family for now. The reason I’m wary of them knowing about my feelings is because they don’t really believe in mental health issues. I honestly find it pretty upsetting to even talk about their beliefs and so the idea of telling them I want to seek help is out of the question. I still want to move forward with seeking some kind of help, but I have some very specific questions that I hope this sub can maybe answer: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. I am still registered with my childhood GP, in a town around 10 miles away. I have no way of getting there as I can’t drive. Would I be able to switch to a more local GP without the rest of my family (who are all still registered there) being notified? \n",
      "\n",
      "2. I actually received counselling sessions from my university earlier this year. However, I cancelled the sessions when I moved home as all sessions were done via zoom and I was uncomfortable talking about my issues in front of my family (my dad works from home, my brother only works part time and my mother works unpredictable hours). Is face to face counselling available on the NHS? If not, Is there any way I can specify that I would like face to face counselling at a different location for the sake of confidentiality? If that isn’t possible, is there any way I could maybe communicate with a counsellor via text or email? \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Can my parents be alerted at all about anything I say? I am obviously an adult, but what happens if I need medication or if I need to be sectioned?  Would my parents be informed about this, since I live with them and they are my closest relatives? \n",
      "\n",
      "Any help or advice for going forward is massively appreciated. I know I’ve written loads here and I have some really specific questions but I just need some help to make sense of it all.\n",

      "Marie started collecting the many different beautiful colours of sea glass, shells & pottery that had been naturally tumbled by the sea over years, decades and sometimes even centuries. As with many people with Mental Health problems, Marie suffered a big relapse and after some excellent treatment with the Drs and PCT team, Marie decided one day to try & make a necklace using some sea glass and we both quickly realised how talented Marie was as a jewellery maker. I also noticed from a personal view how at peace Marie was with herself when she was making jewellery and Hey Presto ARGYLLSEAGLASS was born, making handmade jewellery Argyll Scotland.' \n",
