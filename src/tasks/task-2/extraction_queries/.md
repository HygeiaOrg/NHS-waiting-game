### The 2 help csvs for extraction of posts 

#### For extracting posts from data sources that may give too general posts, such as Twitter etc. We filter posts i.e. posts should atleast talk about themes related to our domain (self harm/mental health problems). For this please use this [query_lexicon](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/london-chapter-nlp-self-harm/blob/main/src/tasks/task-2/extraction_queries/query_lexicon.csv) for filtering.

#### For extracting posts from data sources that do not provide **geo-markers**. We may triangulate posts based on location i.e. posts should be related to the locale of London. For this please use this [london_location_lookup](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/london-chapter-nlp-self-harm/blob/main/src/tasks/task-2/extraction_queries/london_location_lookup.csv) for filtering. -> Additionally, the package [pgeocode](https://pypi.org/project/pgeocode/) can be used to match mentions of zip codes from London.
