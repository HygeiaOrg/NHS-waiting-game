1. Model for classify tweet from mental health category
2. Data to train model were downloaded from https://github.com/AminuIsrael/Predicting-Suicide-Ideation/ 
   and https://github.com/eddieir/Depression_detection_using_Twitter_post/blob/master/depressive_tweets_processed.csv
3. Tweets were labelled manually according to authors
4. After concatenate datasets I have trained LogReg, NaiveBayes, SVM model and LSTM model. 
5. The best model for classify is Logistic Regression. LSTM model has slightly better accuracy but is very heavy.
