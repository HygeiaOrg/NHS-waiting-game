This  notebook    is all about scraping reddit posts via Praw

There are two functions, one to return flairs and another to return a full fledged labeled dataframe. 

We can add  more conditions to the latter according to  our requirements

Update:
Added a main query function(Post_Dataframe2()) that returns only relevant posts

Update:
Using the above created functions we scrape and store our data, the query being "** F" (**  being a number 10-24)
Ignore any errors in Documentations
Will update documentation asap.
