If you have been bereaved by suicide, there are no easy solutions to the difficult situations and trying times you face. The mixture of bewilderment, sadness, anger, and uncertainty are feelings common to those affected by suicide, unfortunately, most people affected don’t know this. Our service is provided by professionals who have personal experience with suicide, offering a safe environment to discuss your bereavement at a time and via a method, you feel most comfortable with. We can offer telephone, email, and outreach appointments either at home or at a mutually convenient venue.  If you are feeling suicidal we know that feeling helpless, worthless, or hopeless are common feelings associated with feeling suicidal. Often these thoughts can be overwhelming and prevent you from feeling anything else. Sharing or expressing these feelings can be helpful but we believe that is just the start to creating meaningful change. Our team is here to provide longer-term practical and emotional support within a non-clinical setting to those experiencing thoughts of suicide. Providing timely and appropriate support can help to create change. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem - Let us help you through the problem.
